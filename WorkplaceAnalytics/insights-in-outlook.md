(Powered by MyAnalytics)

Did you ever miss an important email or forget a commitment you made to your co-workers? Do meetings and emails tend to take over your calendar? 

Do you ever wish to see reminders for 1:1 meetings with your manager, direct reports, or other top collaborators? Would you like to be notified if an upcoming meeting doesn't have a quorum? 

If your answer to any of these questions is _yes_, we have exciting news for you. We are making an Outlook add-in that gives you actionable insights available to all Office 365 commercial users. 

## To open the add-in
