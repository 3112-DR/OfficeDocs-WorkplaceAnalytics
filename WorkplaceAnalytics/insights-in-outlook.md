<!-- 
1) Leave these paragraph tags intact. The H1 heading won't work without them. 
2) Note: We need to keep "layout: HubPage" in the metadata or else we get the TOC in the left pane.
3) Working on how to remove the breadcrumbs pane. Trying adding extendBreadcrumb: false to the metadata but this didn't seem to do anything.

# Productivity insights in Outlook

_(Powered by MyAnalytics)_

Did you ever miss an important email or forget a commitment you made to your co-workers? Do meetings and emails tend to take over your calendar? Do you ever wish to see reminders for 1:1 meetings with your manager, direct reports, or other top collaborators? Would you like to be notified if an upcoming meeting doesn't have a quorum? 

If your answer to any of these questions is _yes_, we have exciting news for you. We are making an Outlook add-in that gives you actionable insights available to all Office 365 commercial users. 

## Insights that you might see

The insights appear in the right panel of Outlook:

## Privacy by design 

The Outlook add-in preserves all the data subject rights afforded by GDPR. The insights users see in the add-in are only available to them. No admin or manager can see those insights. They are computed on the fly based on the user's email and meeting information, and are never cached, stored, or moved out of the user's mailbox. Additionally, the add-in does not pre-process user data. [Learn more](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/CloudServices/office365/default.aspx) about how Microsoft protects your privacy.
