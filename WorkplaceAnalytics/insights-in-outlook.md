<!-- 
1) Leave these paragraph tags intact. The H1 heading won't work without them. 
2) Note: We need to keep "layout: HubPage" in the metadata or else we get the TOC in the left pane.
3) Working on how to remove the breadcrumbs pane. Trying adding extendBreadcrumb: false to the metadata but this didn't seem to do anything.

# Productivity insights in Outlook

_(Powered by MyAnalytics)_

Did you ever miss an important email or forget a commitment you made to your co-workers? Do meetings and emails tend to take over your calendar? Do you ever wish to see reminders for 1:1 meetings with your manager, direct reports, or other top collaborators? Would you like to be notified if an upcoming meeting doesn't have a quorum? 

If your answer to any of these questions is _yes_, we have exciting news for you. We are making an Outlook add-in that gives you actionable insights available to all Office 365 commercial users. 

## To open the add-in 

<ol>

  <li> In Microsoft Outlook or in the Outlook Web App, open an email message.</li>
  <li> Select the swirl in the top-right corner of the email message: 

  ![Productivity insights](images/mya/overview/productivity-insights.png)
  </li>

</ol>

## Insights

The insights appear in the right panel of Outlook, after you have selected the swirl icon:

### Insights that you might see

The following insights appear as cards in the right panel of Outlook:

<ul>
  <li> <b>Book focus time</b>: Protect your calendar by reserving focus time before meetings take over. The following insight card can help you do this:

  <li> <b>To-do reminders</b>: Make sure nothing falls through the cracks with reminders of tasks you promised to complete for coworkers over email. </li>

  <li> <b>Unread email</b>: Cut through the clutter with a summary of unread emails from your most important contacts. </li>

  <li> <b>Meeting prep</b>: Get a heads up on meeting conflicts on your calendar, attendees that haven’t yet accepted your invites, and other meeting prep tips. </li>

  <li> <b>Suggestions for 1:1s</b>: Set up 1:1s with important contacts that you haven’t met with for a few weeks. </li>

  <li> <b>After-hours impact</b>: Help your team achieve work-life balance by reviewing the impact of your after-hours emails.</li>

</ul>

## Privacy by design 

Your insights are private, personal, and only you can see them. They are computed on the fly based on your email and meeting information and are never cached, stored, or moved out of your mailbox.
