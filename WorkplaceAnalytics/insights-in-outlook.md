# Productivity insights in Outlook

> [!Note] 
> Exciting news! Productivity insights that are powered by MyAnalytics are becoming broadly available for Office 365 users. This article describes the new capabilities that these users will get.

Did you ever miss an important email or forget a commitment you made to your co-workers? Do meetings and emails tend to take over your calendar? Do you ever wish to see reminders for 1:1 meetings with your manager, direct reports, or other top collaborators? Would you like to be notified if an upcoming meeting doesn't have a quorum?

If your answer to any of these questions is _yes_, the Outlook add-in provides actionable insights to help you stay on top of your tasks and get more done.

## Insights that you might see

If you are using Outlook Web App, first open an email message and then select Outlook add-in in the top-right corner of your email message, next to the **Reply** button. After you launch the add-in, the insights cards are displayed in the right panel:
