# What's new in Workplace Analytics Azure Templates

Azure templates for Workplace Analytics will continue to develop new templates and add new features and enhancements to the current set of templates. This page will be updated monthly with each new release.

## June 2019

The following new template and template enhancements are now available in this month's release.

### Process Explorer Azure Template

This release adds a new Process Explorer template that helps you understand where your organization or team is investing or expending valuable time. You can use this template to categorize processes, projects, meetings, and other activities. You can either upload a .csv dataset for meeting activity or connect to a blob storage location for meeting and email activity.

To learn more, see [Process Explorer Azure Template](./process-explorer.md).

### Group Analysis Azure Template

This release adds a new Group Analysis Azure template that helps you compare two groups, such as managers and individual contributors, and evaluate the major differences between them. You can proactively evaluate differences between different groups and address any areas that need improvement between the groups.

To learn more, see [Group Analysis Azure Template](./process-explorer.md).

### Organization Network Analysis Azure Template

The following enhancements and features are included in the Organization Network Analysis (ONA) Azure Template.

#### Comparative analysis

With the ONA template, you can now view and compare two networks side by side with two browser windows, such as to compare:

* Two different time periods to see how a network has evolved (before and after analysis)
* Between different metrics, such as betweenness and intersectionality, for the same time period
* Two different filters, such as by job title and level designation, for the same time period

#### Density measure

You can now analyze cohesion within groups and across groups by density, which is a new measure in the ONA template. This table view depicts the density score within and across the respective groups.

#### Save and view saved graphs

You can now save a data analysis graph in the template, and then view it as a saved graph later.

To learn more, see [Organization Network Analysis Azure Template](./organization-network-analysis.md).
