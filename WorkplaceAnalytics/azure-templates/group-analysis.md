# Workplace Analytics Group Analysis Azure Template

_These templates are only available as part of a Microsoft service engagement._

Workplace Analytics Azure Templates includes the Group Analysis template that enables you to compare two groups, such as managers and individual contributors, and determine the major differences between them.

You can choose which metrics to analyze and which attributes remain the same between the groups to foster a more robust comparison. This type of analysis can help proactively discover and address areas that need improvement in your organization.

After you upload a dataset, you can use the template tools to view data for the two groups with visual charts and lists, as shown in the following graphic.
