# Workplace Analytics Topic Analysis Azure Template

Workplace Analytics Azure Templates includes the Topic Analysis template that enables you to quickly analyze a range of metrics about meetings based on topic keywords. You can use these metrics to evaluate who spent how much time in key meetings and reading and sending emails about these key meetings.  

You can use this template to view and analyze meeting metrics with the following features:

* **Word Cloud**: After you select a dataset and run a query with an initial keyword, the Word Cloud will show keywords that are relevant or close to the initial keyword. You can then select another keyword in the cloud to add to your list and run the query again. Each time, the cloud will adjust based on the keywords listed. Itâ€™ll include meeting subjects that contain either of the keywords (OR) or a combination of the keywords (AND). The larger the word, the more closely it relates to the initial keyword.
* **Meetings Summary**: Summarizes the key data points about the meetings in the query, including: the total count of meetings, the count of meetings based on search criteria, the average duration hours, and the average attendees. It also provides a chart view of the data that you can change by selecting different meeting metrics to show in the chart, such as meeting hours, emails sent, or conflicting meetings for attendees.
* **Meetings Detail**: Shows the meeting metric details in a table, which is based on the search criteria for the query and the organizational data imported from Workplace Analytics. You can sort the table view by the Meeting Start Date. You can also download the meeting details as a .csv file for further analysis in another tool, such as Excel or Power BI.
