# Activate a Workplace Analytics license

You can activate additional Workplace Analytics licenses for an Office 365 tenant. By using a code that you receive from us, your Office 365 admins can follow these steps to add the code and set up the organization with additional licenses for a set period of time.

### To activate additional Workplace Analytics licenses

1. Start your web browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox, for **InPrivate**, **incognito**, or **Private** browsing.

2. Depending on which browser you are using, on the Windows taskbar or Start menu, right-click the browser application and select **Start InPrivate Browsing**, **New InPrivate window**, **New incognito window**, or **New private window**.

3. Copy the activation code link, which you received from us, paste it into the URL section of the private or incognito browser window, and then press **Enter** to open the link.

5. On the **Sign in** page, type your admin credentials.
6. On the **Check out** page, select **Try Now** to confirm the order.
7. When you get the order receipt, save it and then select **Continue**.
8. To confirm that the codes were successfully added to your environment, go to **Admin Center** > **Users** > **Active Users**.

   For example,  https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/Home#/users

9. Select a user account, and then next to **Product licenses**, select **Edit**.

   For example, the following screenshot shows 25 new licenses.
