# Environment requirements for Workplace Analytics

### Office 365 tenant requirements

Workplace Analytics requires an Office 365 tenant with Exchange Online.  Mailboxes must have [Exchange Online Plan 1 or Plan 2 licenses assigned](https://products.office.com/exchange/compare-microsoft-exchange-online-plans).

Currently, Workplace Analytics supports multi-tenant and vNext environments. Each mailbox that you want to license must have its data stored in Exchange Online.

### Workplace Analytics licenses and trials

Workplace Analytics is licensed as an add-on to existing Office 365 subscriptions. Licenses are $2/license per month for Office 365 Enterprise E5 subscriptions and $6/license per month for all other qualifying Office 365 subscriptions. Licensing Workplace Analytics does not change the end-user experience in Office 365.

Workplace Analytics licenses are applied to the mailboxes that you want to analyze. This can be all the employees in your organization or a specific subset. The population of employees that you license are referred to in Workplace Analytics as _measured employees_. Because Workplace Analytics insights are de-identified and aggregated, measured-employee populations typically benefit the most if they consist of at least several hundred people.

Microsoft does not currently offer trials of Workplace Analytics. For more information about Workplace Analytics and how to purchase it, contact your Microsoft account team. 

### Supported browsers

Workplace Analytics works with the latest or immediately previous versions of Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, Internet Explorer, and Mozilla Firefox.
