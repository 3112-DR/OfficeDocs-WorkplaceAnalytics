# Workplace Analytics Promotional trial

You can take advantage of Workplace Analytics promotional trials to set up your organization with additional Workplace Analytics licenses on a trial basis. By using a promotional code that you receive from us, Office 365 admins can follow these steps to add the code and set up the organization with additional licenses:

### To add a promotional trial code in Workplace Analytics

1. Start your web browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox, for **InPrivate**, **incognito**, or **Private** browsing.

2. Depending on which browser you are using, on the Windows taskbar or Start menu, right-click the browser application and select **Start InPrivate Browsing**, **New InPrivate window**, **New incognito window**, or **New private window**.
