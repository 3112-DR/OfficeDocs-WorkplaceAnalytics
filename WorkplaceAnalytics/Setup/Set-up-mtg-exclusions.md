* **Owner** - Workplace Analytics administrator, data analysts with full access
* **Task** - Set meeting exclusion rules to reflect your company's meeting norms and exclude meetings that are not relevant for analysis.  
* **Outcome** - Workplace Analytics administrators and analysts are satisfied that meeting query results are focused on the data relevant for analysis.

Workplace Analytics uses activities stored in a person’s Office 365 email and calendar to reveal internal and external collaboration trends. However, a person’s calendar and email can contain a diverse set of activities (such as personal meetings, work-related social activities, all-day training meetings, and so forth) that are not relevant to work-related collaboration, and if included in the metrics, can skew query results.

Analysts can use the Meeting exclusions feature to create custom meeting exclusions that help ensure query results accurately represent relevant meeting norms within their company. Or, analysts may choose to use the default meeting exclusions that exclude a set of meetings that would commonly fall outside relevant collaboration for analysis.
