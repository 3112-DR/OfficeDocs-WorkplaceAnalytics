# Maintain Workplace Analytics

After you have installed Workplace Analytics and your organization is using it, it will require maintenance by an admin. Some maintenance tasks are needed infrequently, while others must be performed  regularly.  

## Update configuration settings

 * **Task**: Set the default time zone and the default settings for working days and hours.  
 * **Frequency**: As needed 

[Configure system settings](configure-wpa-settings.md#system-settings)

## Update privacy settings

 * **Task**: Configure the following settings: 
    * Set the minimum group size for display in charts and dashboards. 
    * Decide to show or hide subject lines in meeting reports.
    * Make settings to include or exclude emails or meetings by indicating particular user email addresses, domains, and phrases on the subject line.
 * **Frequency**: As needed. Perform this task after your organization has decided that the current settings are insufficient or inaccurate.

## Update organizational data 

 * **Task**: Prepare a .csv file that contains organizational data and upload it to Workplace Analytics.  
 * **Frequency**: Regularly. You can update organizational data as frequently as you like, but it will be refreshed upon the latest update of email and calendar data. Since email and calendar data is updated once a month, it makes sense to provide a updates for this data on a similar cadence.

## Assign licenses  

 * **Task**: Assign Workplace Analytics licenses to individuals.  
 * **Frequency**: As needed. Perform this task primarily as one step in the onboarding of a new employee.

## Assign roles

 * **Task**: Assign Workplace Analytics roles to individuals.  
 * **Frequency**: As needed. Perform this step when a new employee requires one of the Workplace Analytics roles, or an existing employee changes roles.

## Validate and verify data

 * **Task**: Use the Data sources section to verify that Office 365 and organizational data are loaded and ready for use.
 * **Frequency**: As needed -- in particular, after uploading organizational data.

## Set up meeting exclusions

 * **Task**: Create custom meeting exclusion rules to remove meetings from analysis.  
 * **Frequency**: As needed. Create these rules to exclude meetings that might skew your data.
