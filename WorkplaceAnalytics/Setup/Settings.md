On the Settings page, administrators can customize system defaults and privacy settings, and upload organizational data to Workplace Analytics. There are two tabs, **Settings** and **Organizational data**.

# Settings
In the **System defaults** section, you can customize the Default time zone. This is used to compute after hours metrics for employees who donâ€™t have a time zone already populated.
In the **Privacy settings** section, you customize and configure what data is accessible for analysis.

**Note** When adding the subject line words to exclude from analysis, use single words, separated by a semicolon.

### With privacy settings you can
* Specify the smallest group size to appear in the Explore Metrics section. Larger group sizes reduce the risk of individual group members being personally identified.
* Specify whether subject lines should be shown in query results.
* Exclude sensitive emails, domains, or subject line keywords.
