## Seller insights Q & A

<!-- For Madhura, get FWLink to here for use in the product UI --> 

**Q1.** As a participant in a Seller success plan, what guidance will I receive to help me during my participation in the plan?  

**A1.** After the plan starts, you will regularly receive a tailored email. This mail starts out by summarizing how you spent your time in internal and external collaboration during the preceding month. For more information, see [Seller insights monthly email](#seller-insights-monthly-email).

**Q2.**  Why am I receiving this email? 

**A2.** You receive the monthly "Seller insights" email so that you can visualize aspects of your sales-related behavior. The insights and suggestions in this email, which are based on recent collaboration with your customers and partners, can help you make course corrections with the goal of helping your sales productivity.
 
**Q3.** What am I supposed to do with the information in this email?

**A3.** It depends on the particular insight. For example, you can use the _Time with customers_ data to make large or small shifts in the amount of time you spend communicating with particular customers. You can use the data in the _Leverage internal networks_ card to adjust the time that you spend communicating with particular internal groups&mdash;such as solution specialists&mdash;to a more appropriate level.

**Q4.** This email contains charts that describe my workplace behavior. Where did this data come from?

**A4.** On a weekly basis, Workplace Analytics receives from Office 365 a copy of the preceding week's collaboration data about the emails, meetings, calls, and chats that took place. Also, the admins in your organization regularly upload two sets of data to Workplace Analytics: organizational data (descriptive data about employees), and CRM data (for example, customer account information, sales records, and purchasing history). Workplace Analytics then processes these data streams together to uncover the insights that it presents to you in the seller-insights email.   

**Q5.** Who else can see this data about me? 

**A5.** The data that you see in the seller insights email is your own data and only you have access to it. Your manager, your admin, and your teammates cannot see it. As is stated at the top of the email itself, this data is for your eyes only. 

**Q6.** Could this data be used for other purposes? 

**A6.** There is no mechanism or option that allows anyone but you to access the personalized information that you receive in this email, unless you purposefully and independently share that information. The data and insights provided by this feature cannot be used for automated decision-making or for profiling.
