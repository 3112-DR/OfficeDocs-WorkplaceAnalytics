# Get started with Workplace Analytics

Microsoft Workplace Analytics is a cloud-based service that provides rich, actionable insights into your company’s communication and collaboration trends that help you make more effective business decisions.

Combining the organizational data that your company chooses to provide with email and calendar metadata from Office 365, Workplace Analytics enables analysts to provide business leaders with unprecedented insights about how people spend their time, and who they spend it with. These insights empower business leaders to drive strategies for sales, employee engagement, and productivity initiatives.

You can explore the data with the Workplace Analytics dashboards, and dive deeper into your company’s behavioral metrics by using custom queries and query templates that can be exported to enable offline analysis.

## More about Workplace Analytics

Workplace Analytics gives you different ways to explore your data.

**Home** gives a high-level overview of collaboration and links to popular features.

**Explore** has a set of analytical dashboards that are the starting point to gain quick insights into your data and identify where you want to investigate further.
  
* [**Week in the life**](../use/explore-metrics-week-in-the-life.md) gives a summary of day-to-day collaboration in the organization.

You can create three types of queries in Workplace Analytics: Person, Group, and Meeting. Each query type can help answer specific questions you may be investigating.
