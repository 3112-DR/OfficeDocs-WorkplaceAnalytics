# Get started with Workplace Analytics

Microsoft Workplace Analytics is a cloud-based service that provides rich, actionable insights into your company’s communication and collaboration trends that help you make more effective business decisions.

Combining the organizational data that your company chooses to provide with email and calendar metadata from Office 365, Workplace Analytics enables analysts to provide business leaders with unprecedented insights about how people spend their time, and who they spend it with. These insights empower business leaders to drive strategies for sales, employee engagement, and productivity initiatives.

You can explore the data with the Workplace Analytics dashboards, and dive deeper into your company’s behavioral metrics by using custom queries and query templates that can be exported to enable offline analysis.

## Data analysis

Workplace Analytics gives you different ways to analyze and explore your data.

**Home** gives a high-level overview of collaboration and links to popular features.

**Explore** has a set of analytical dashboards that are the starting point to gain quick insights into your data and identify where you want to investigate further.
  
* [**Week in the life**](../use/explore-metrics-week-in-the-life.md) gives a summary of day-to-day collaboration in the organization.
* [**Meetings overview**](../use/explore-metrics-meetings-overview.md) gives a summary of meeting norms within your organization.
* [**Management and coaching**](../use/explore-metrics-management-and-coaching.md) gives a summary of collaboration between leaders, managers and employees.
* [**Internal networks**](../use/Explore-Metrics-internal-networks.md) gives a summary of your employees’ networking patterns within the company.
* [**External collaboration**](../use/Explore-Metrics-external-collaboration.md) gives a summary of your employees’ networking patterns with people outside the company. 



[**Sources**](../use/data-sources.md) give you a deeper look at the data available for study within Workplace Analytics. You can see both Office 365 data and the organizational data you have imported for analysis.

[**Queries**](../tutorials/create-queries.md) give you the flexibility to dive deeper into your organization’s behavioral metrics to generate insights. You can create three types of queries in Workplace Analytics: Person, Group, and Meeting. Each query type can help answer specific questions you may be investigating.

[**Solutions**](../tutorials/solutions-intro.md) helps you transform insights from Workplace Analytics into targeted change programs across your organization. Targeted change programs are available for reducing meeting load, increasing focus time, and maintaining work-life balance.

[**Settings**](../use/settings.md) enable you to customize system defaults and privacy settings. You must be an admin to access the Settings page.

**Page settings** for both the Explore and Solutions pages (open on the right side) enables you to change the date range, how to group measured employees, and the filter for active, inactive, or all employees. By default, the Explore and Solutions pages are filtered to show active employees only. Active employees are those who sent at least one email during the set date range (the aggregated time period set for the query or solution).
