# Frequently asked questions for Workplace Analytics

> [!Note] 
> The sets of questions and answers in this topic apply to participants in Seller success plans of Workplace Analytics.

**Q1.** As a participant in the Seller success plan, what guidance will I receive to help me during my participation in the plan?  

<!-- For Madhura, get FWLink to here for use in the product UI -->

**A1.** After the plan starts, you will regularly receive a tailored email. This mail starts out by summarizing how you spent your time in internal and external collaboration during the preceding week. For more information, see [Seller success weekly email](#seller-success-weekly-email).

**Q2.**  Why am I receiving this email?

**A2.** You receive this weekly "Seller insights" email to make it simple to visualize aspects of your recent sales-related behavior. The insights and suggestions in this email, which are based on your collaboration with your customers and partners, can help you make course corrections with the goal of helping your sales productivity.
 
**Q3.** What am I supposed to do with the information in this email?

**A3.** It depends on the particular insight. For example, you can use the _Time with customers_ data to make large or small shifts in the amount of time you spend communicating with particular customers. You can use the data in the _Leverage internal networks_ card to adjust the time that you spend communicating with particular internal groups&mdash;such as solution specialists&mdash;to a more appropriate level.

**Q4.** This email contains charts that describe my workplace behavior. Where did this data come from?

**A4.** On a weekly basis, Workplace Analytics receives from Office 365 a copy of the preceding week's collaboration data about the emails, meetings, calls, and chats that took place. Also, the admins in your organization regularly upload two sets of data to Workplace Analytics: [organizational data](../setup/prepare-organizational-data.md) (descriptive data about employees), and [CRM data](../setup/crm-data-upload.md) (including customer account information, sales records, and purchasing history). Workplace Analytics then processes these data streams together to uncover the insights that it presents to you in the seller-success email.   

**Q5.** Who else can see this data about me? 

**A5.** The data that you see in the seller success email is your own data and only you have access to it. Your manager, your admin, and your teammates cannot see it. As is stated at the top of the email, this data is for your eyes only. For more information, see [Data privacy in Workplace Analytics](#data-privacy-in-workplace-analytics). 

## Seller success weekly email

A weekly sales-digest email is intended to help you be more successful by streamlining your behaviors based on the following elements of sales success: time with customers, depth of engagement, internal networks, and connection with leadership. This mail starts out by summarizing how you spent your time in internal and external collaboration during the preceding week:

![Email top](../images/wpa/tutorials/email-top.png)

This email can contain any of several descriptive cards, each of which is designed to help you work more effectively:

 * [Time with customers](#time-with-customers)
 * [Depth of engagement](#depth-of-engagement)
 * [Leverage internal networks](#leverage-internal-networks)
 * [Connect with leadership](#connect-with-leadership)

Each card offers a targeted suggestion. In three of the cards, the **Suggestion** section contains an **Explore** option that you can select to learn more about this suggestion and how it can be of benefit. The fourth card, [Connect with leadership](#connect-with-leadership), has a **Manage meetings** option. Select **Manage meetings** to view your upcoming meetings in the Outlook web calendar and, optionally, to make changes to those meetings.    

The cards are described in the following sections: 

### Time with customers

The _Time with customers_ card displays how you spent your time with your customers over the past seven days. Its chart reflects total collaboration hours with each customer.

Its purpose is to help you decide whether you are spending time optimally with customers according to their respective potential.

On this card, select **Explore** to open the **Network** page of the MyAnalytics personal dashboard to see more details about how (with whom) you spent your time. 

### Depth of engagement

In the _Depth of engagement_ section, the **People you engaged with** column shows the number of distinct people in the account with which you had one or more meaningful interaction in last 28 days.

On this card, select **Explore** to open the **Network** page of the MyAnalytics personal dashboard to see more details about how (with whom) you spent your time. 

### Leverage internal networks

Being connected with the right individuals and organizations within the company can help overall performance. The _Leverage internal networks_ card displays the number of hours you collaborated with particular internal groups. It calls your attention to these figures so that you can improve your depth of customer engagement by strengthening your internal networks.

On this card, select **Explore** to open the **Network** page of the MyAnalytics personal dashboard to see more details about how (with whom) you spent your time. 

### Connect with leadership

Spending time with and getting attention from your manager and other senior people in your own organization is important for the success of salespeople. The chart on the _Connect with leadership_ card displays the time the salesperson spent with their manager (or “leadership,” managers above their immediate manager) in meetings with particular customers.

On this card, select **Manage meetings** to open the [calendar week view of Outlook](https://outlook.office.com/calendar/view/week). 

## Data privacy in Workplace Analytics

Workplace Analytics operates under the following privacy principles:

 * [You own the data in your inbox](#you-own-the-data-in-your-inbox)
 * [No one but you sees your data](#no-one-but-you-sees-your-data)

### You own the data in your inbox

When you look in your Office 365 mailbox, you see a record of interactions that you’ve had with other people. These interactions are of various kinds: emails that you’ve sent and received, meeting invitations, chats and calls. Because it’s your mailbox, you have a right to access it and view the information that it contains. In other words, your mailbox content is information that’s freely available to you.

Most of the interactions in your mailbox involve other people – for example, co-workers who’ve sent you emails or meeting invitations or received them from you. These interactions provide you with a bit of information about how those co-workers used the communication tools of Office 365. If you want to know how many emails your manager sent you last month (eight, let’s say), you probably wouldn’t ask her. Instead, you open your Outlook inbox, sort it by sender, and count.

The fact that those eight emails were sent by your manager doesn’t mean that this metadata about them (the count of emails) belongs only to her. It also belongs to you, because you received these emails.
If you send an email to your IT person, you can assume he’ll know that you sent it, and when. Sending it means that you’ve chosen to reveal it (both its contents and its metadata) to him.

**Conclusion:** What's in your inbox is yours. Your right to view the items in your inbox supersedes any other person’s right to privacy over those items.

### No one but you sees your data

Let’s say you want to dig deeper into what’s in your inbox. For example, how many emails did you send to your co-workers in your off-work hours last week? How many did you send the week before, and the week before that?

You might want to uncover trends. Did you work more in your off hours before the winter break or after it? This sort of question is answered through analysis. That is where analytical tools such as Workplace Analytics can play a role.

This tool looks in your inbox and in your calendar, crunches numbers, and gives insight into your behavior: How many emails did you send? How many meetings did you attend? Considering your emails and your meetings, how much time did you spend with customers? How many contacts did you have with each customer?

Rather than having to open your mailbox folders and count items, or open your calendar and add up meeting times, you can see data of this sort summarized in the seller-solution email summary provided by Workplace Analytics. 

**Conclusion:** Only you can see your Workplace Analytics data. Workplace Analytics insights are derived from data that was already available to you in your inbox.
