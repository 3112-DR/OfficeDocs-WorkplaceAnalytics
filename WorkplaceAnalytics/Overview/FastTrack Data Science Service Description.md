# Workplace Analytics FastTrack Data Science Service Description

## Service Overview
The Workplace Analytics Data Science Service offered under Office 365 FastTrack provides you additional data exports with customized metrics to supplement what your users can get on their own using the Workplace Analytics platform. This service is available for customers with active Office 365 services for Workplace Analytics.

## Policy and steps
* Service requests are defined in collaboration with a Workplace Analytics FastTrack project manager.
* Service requests are fulfilled between 9am-5pm Pacific Time. Requests may take multiple days to complete, depending on the complexity of the request.
* Microsoft may require you to provide appropriate access and permissions to perform data science service activities.

## Output
* Data file with a pre-defined set of rows and columns is made available for download from within the Office365 tenant 
* Email completion report is provided by FastTrack project manager 

## Services out-of-scope
* Data interpretation and analysis on data output file is out of scope for these services 

## FastTrack Data Science Service Specialists do the following
* Provide a standard template for defining and documenting the data science request
* Provide information on required permissions for Microsoft personnel
* Create and run scripts to output downloadable data files
* Validate that data output files have desired structure and content
* Provide completion report

## Your responsibilities
* Complete the data science request template
* Provide Microsoft personnel with access and permissions to your online services environment as necessary for them to perform data science activities
* Handle all communications with end users 

## Advisory notes
* If the Workplace Analytics Data Science Service that you have requested is for a project on which you are working with a third-party service provider (such as a consultant that you have hired), then Microsoft will treat that third-party service provider as acting on your behalf and may share your data with that third-party service provider. Microsoft will not be responsible for the handling of your data by that third-party service provider.
* Except as set forth in an agreement between Microsoft and your organization, data provided through the FastTrack services may be transferred to, stored, and processed anywhere that Microsoft maintains facilities, and the FastTrack services arenâ€™t designed or intended for data subject to special legal or regulatory requirements.
* If you provided Microsoft personnel with login credentials to access your online services environment, then Microsoft recommends that you revoke those credentials when the assignment has been completed or terminates.
