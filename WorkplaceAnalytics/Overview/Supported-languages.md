# Workplace Analytics supported languages and guidelines

Workplace Analytics user interface is currently available in English only. However, you can use Workplace Analytics with data in other languages. For the best experience, use the following guidelines.

## These items must be in English 
* The query name and description

![Query name and description](../Images/WpA/Overview/query-name-description.png)
* The organizational data column headers when [preparing and uploading organizational data](../Use/Prepare-and-upload-organizational-data.md)

> [!TIP]
> Content within the organizational data may be in languages other than English.
## Privacy settings

In [Privacy settings](../use/settings#privacy-settings), when adding the subject line terms to exclude from analysis, Workplace Analytics may not recognize uncommon compound words, especially those in other languages such as Japanese or Chinese. For best results, use single words, separated by a semicolon.

We appreciate all user feedback. To report any language-related bugs, use the **Send feedback** button.
