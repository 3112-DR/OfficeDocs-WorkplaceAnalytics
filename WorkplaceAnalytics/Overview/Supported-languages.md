# Workplace Analytics language support and guidelines

The Workplace Analytics user interface is currently available in English, Japanese, and French. However, you can use Workplace Analytics with data in other languages. For the best experience, use the following guidelines:

## These items must be in English, Japanese, or French

* Query names and descriptions

![Query names and descriptions](../Images/WpA/Overview/query-name-description.png)

* Column headers for the organizational data when you [prepare the organizational data](../Setup/Prepare-organizational-data.md)

> [!TIP]
> For content within organizational data, you can use languages other than English.

## Privacy settings

In [Privacy settings](../use/settings.md#privacy-settings), when adding the subject line terms to exclude from analysis, Workplace Analytics might not recognize uncommon compound words, especially those in other languages such as Japanese or Chinese. For best results, use single words, separated by a semicolon.

We appreciate all your feedback. To report any language-related issues, use the **Send feedback** button.
