# Environment Requirements

## Ofice 365 tenant requirements 
Workplace Analytics requires an Office 365 tenant with
Exchange Online.  [[CONTENT PLACEHOLDER - Mailboxes must have exchange online 1, 2 or 3 licenses assigned â€“ awaiting content language from RD]]

Currently, Workplace Analytics supports multi-tenant and vNext environments. Each mailbox that you want to license must have its data stored in Exchange Online. 

## Workplace Analytics Licenses
Workplace Analytics is licensed as an add-on to existing Office 365 subscriptions and does not change the end-user experience in Office 365. Workplace Analytics licenses are applied to the mailboxes that you want to analyze. The population of employees that you license are referred to in Workplace Analytics as measured employees. 

For more information about Workplace Analytics and how to purchase it, contact your Microsoft account team. 

## Supported browsers
Workplace Analytics works with the latest or immediately previous versions of Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Apple Safari and Mozilla Firefox.
