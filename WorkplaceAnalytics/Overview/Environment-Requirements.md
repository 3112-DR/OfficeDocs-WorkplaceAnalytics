# Environment Requirements

## O365 Tenant Requirements 
Workplace Analytics requires an Office 365 tenant with an Exchange Online footprint.  Currently, Workplace Analytics supports Multitenant and vNext environments.
Each mailbox that you wish to analyze, must have its data stored in Exchange Online. The more data that is available, the better
## Licensing
Workplace Analytics is licensed as an Add-on to existing office subscriptions. Workplace Analytics office 365 licenses are applied to the mailboxes which you wish to analyze. Assigning this license does not expose any additional features or capabilities to the mailbox that it is assigned. To apply a workplace analytics license to a mailbox, the mailbox must have exchange online 1, 2 or 3 license assigned. Reach out to your account team for more details on purchasing Workplace Analytics.
## Supported browsers
Workplace Analytics is designed to work with the latest or immediately previous versions of Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Apple Safari and Mozilla Firefox.
