# Environment Requirements

## Office 365 tenant requirements 
Workplace Analytics requires an Office 365 tenant with Exchange Online.  [[CONTENT PLACEHOLDER - Mailboxes must have exchange online 1, 2 or 3 licenses assigned â€“ awaiting content language from RD]]

Currently, Workplace Analytics supports multi-tenant and vNext environments. Each mailbox that you want to license must have its data stored in Exchange Online. 

## Workplace Analytics licenses
Workplace Analytics is licensed as an add-on to existing Office 365 subscriptions and does not change the end-user experience in Office 365. 

Workplace Analytics licenses are applied to the mailboxes that you want to analyze. This can be all the employees in your organization, or a specific subset. The population of employees that you license are referred to in Workplace Analytics as _measured employees_. 

For more information about Workplace Analytics and how to purchase it, contact your Microsoft account team. 

## Supported browsers
Workplace Analytics works with the latest or immediately previous versions of Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Apple Safari and Mozilla Firefox.
