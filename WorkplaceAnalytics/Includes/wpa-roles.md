* **Analyst**: Has full access to all service features except for two admin-task pages (**Upload** and **Admin settings**) that are reached through the **Settings** menu. The **Analyst** role provides analysts with the most complete access to data.

* **Analyst (Limited Access)**: Same access as for those in the **Analyst** role but with the following restrictions:
   * No access to **Queries**. 
   * Only _read-only_ access to the **Analysis settings** page (on which meeting exclusion rules are defined).

* **Administrator**: Has access to the **Settings** menu and through it the **Data sources**, **Upload**, and **Admin settings** pages. The Workplace Analytics admin has the responsibility to configure privacy settings and system defaults and to  prepare, upload, and verify organizational data. 

  > [!NOTE] 
  > Workplace Analytics admins are not Office 365 admins. Therefore, unless they have *also* been granted the role of Office 365 administrator, they have access only to organizational data, not to Office 365 data.

* **Program manager**: Has access to the **Home** page of Workplace Analytics. Program managers also can open the **Solutions** page and its **Manage** page, where they can set up programs; and to the **Track** page, where they can track the progress of active programs and the state of ended programs.
