* **Analyst**: Has full access to all service features except two pages (**Upload** and **Admin settings**) that are meant only for admins. The **Analyst** role provides analysts with the most complete access to data.

* **Analyst (Limited Access)**: Same access as for those in the **Analyst** role but with the following restrictions:
   * No access to **Queries**. 
   * Only _read-only_ access to the **Analysis settings** page (on which meeting exclusion rules are defined).

* **Administrator**: Has access to the **Settings** menu and through it the **Data sources**, **Upload**, and **Admin settings** pages. The Workplace Analytics admin has the responsibility to configure privacy settings and system defaults and to  prepare, upload, and verify organizational data. 

  > [!NOTE] 
  > Workplace Analytics admins are not Office 365 admins. Therefore, unless they have *also* been granted the role of Office 365 administrator, they have access only to organizational data, not to Office 365 data.

* **Program manager**: Has access to the **Home** page of Workplace Analytics. Program managers also can open the **Solutions** page and its **Manage** page, where they can set up improvement plans; and to the **Track** page, where they can track the plans of active programs and the state of ended plans.

 <!-- DELETE THIS SECTION WHILE WAITING FOR RELEASE THE GM ROLE:  

* **Group manager**: Has access only to the **Solutions** page of Workplace Analytics, where they can set up improvement plans for one group of employees: those who are in their reporting structure. Group managers (GM) can also open the **Solutions** &gt; **Manage** page and the **Solutions** &gt; **Track** page, where they can track the progress of their own active plans and the state of their own ended plans. If you have the GM role assigned as well as the analyst role, the analyst role overrules and you have access to the broader analyst experience, not merely the GM experience.

> User roles are each distinct in their assigned responsibilities and access permissions. Each user role is assigned independently and it gives access only to the actions, pages, dashboards, and data that correspond to that role.
