* **Analyst**: Has full access to all service features except the **Settings** menu, which is used by admins. The **Analyst** role provides analysts with the most complete access to data.

* **Analyst (Limited Access)**: Same access as for those in the **Analyst** role but with the following restrictions:
   * No access to **Queries**. 
   * Only _read-only_ access to the **Analysis settings** page (on which meeting exclusion rules are defined).

* **Administrator**: Has access to the **Settings** menu, which includes the **Data sources** page. The Workplace Analytics admin has the responsibility to configure privacy settings and system defaults and to  prepare, uploade, and verifying organizational data. Workplace Analytics admins are not Office 365 admins; therefore, they have access only to organizational data, not to Office 365 data.

* **Program manager**: Has access to the **Home** page of Workplace Analytics. Program managers also can open the **Solutions** page and its **Manage** page, where they can set up programs; and to the **Track** page, where they can track the progress of active programs and the state of ended programs.
