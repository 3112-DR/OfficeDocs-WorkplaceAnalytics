**Role:** No particular role is required. The only requirement is that participants have _both_ a Workplace Analytics license and a MyAnalytics license.   

After a seller success plan starts, its participants receive a tailored email every month. It starts by summarizing how the salesperson spent their time in internal and external collaboration during the preceding month:

<!-- THIS ONE IS IN SECOND PERSON:

# Seller insights monthly email 

As a participant in a seller-success plan, you receive a monthly seller-insights email. It is meant to help you by streamlining your behavior in several aspects of sales success: time with customers, depth of engagement, internal networks, and connection with leadership. This mail starts out by summarizing how you spent your time in internal and external collaboration during the preceding month:
-->

This email can contain any of several descriptive cards, each of which offers targeted suggestions to help participants work more effectively.  The following sections describe these cards: 

 * [Time with customers](#time-with-customers)
 * [Depth of engagement](#depth-of-engagement)
 * [Manager interaction](#manager-interaction)
 <!--  * [Leverage internal networks](#leverage-internal-networks) -->

<!-- In three of the cards, the **Suggestion** section contains an **Explore** option that the seller can select to learn more about this suggestion and how it can benefit them. -->
<!-- 
The last card, [Manager interaction](#manager-interaction), has a **Manage meetings** option. Selecting **Manage meetings** displays  upcoming meetings in the Outlook web calendar and, optionally, lets sellers make changes to those meetings.  --> 

## Time with customers

The _Time with customers_ card displays how sellers spent their time with  customers over the past month. Its chart reflects the following:
 * The total **Collaboration hours** with each customer during the preceding month. 
* **Change %**: the change from the preceding month in collaboration hours for that account.

Its purpose is to help sellers decide whether they are spending time optimally with customers according to their respective potential.

## Depth of engagement

The _Depth of engagement_ card shows the number of distinct people in the account with which the seller had one or more meaningful interaction in last 28 days.

## Leverage internal networks

Being connected with the right individuals and organizations within the company can help overall performance. The _Leverage internal networks_ card displays the number of hours a seller collaborated with particular internal groups. It calls their attention to these figures so that they can improve their depth of customer engagement by strengthening their internal networks.

## Manager interaction

Spending time with and getting attention from your manager is important for the success of salespeople. The chart on the _Manager interaction_ card displays the time the salesperson spent with their manager in meetings with particular customers.
