# Email read statistics 

MyAnalytics can tell you how many people have opened your emails and how long they spent reading them. It informs you about emails that you sent to five or more Office 365 users who are internal to your company. It displays this information in "cards," such as this one:

After you send an email message, it takes up to fifteen minutes before MyAnalytics can inform you about it. MyAnalytics groups similar information into a single summary card that you can select and expand to see a more detailed view.

To see information about a specific email message 

1. In your Sent Items folder in Outlook, click the email message.  
2. In the Home tab of the ribbon, click **MyAnalytics**. If the MyAnalytics panel is not already open, it opens now. 

    At the top of the panel, a card displays information about the message that you selected. For example, the following card describes the status of the message with the subject line "Document for review":

3. To see more information about this message, click the card. For the selected message, you see a chart that shows the proportion of recipients who have opened your email, and the number of times people replied to it or forwarded it.

    Based on the length of the message, MyAnalytics estimates how long a person needs to read it. It uses that number to decide whether people glanced, skimmed, or read the email, and informs you of this in a card.

    Depending on how many people opened the email and how long they spent reading, MyAnalytics might suggest that you follow up on your email, or it might show tips to help improve email communication.
