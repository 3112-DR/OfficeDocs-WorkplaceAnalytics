**To designate a meeting-exclusion rule as a favorite** 

Marking a rule as a favorite moves has one effect: It moves the rule to the top of the Meeting exclusions drop-down list on the query-creation page.

1. On the **Queries** page, find the row of the meeting-exclusion rule that you want to designate as a favorite. 
2. At the right end of the row, click the star.

After you click the star, it will appear filled-in to indicate the favorite status of this exclusion rule. 

In the following illustration, an analyst has marked the "OOF Meetings" rule as a favorite. It therefore appears at the top of the list:

The order in which rules appear is stored for each analyst. One analyst's designated favorites are independent of other analysts' designated favorites. 

> [!Note] 
> You can designate more than one rule as a favorite. Each subsequent rule you mark as a favorite moves to the top of the list and pushes previously marked favorites down the list.
