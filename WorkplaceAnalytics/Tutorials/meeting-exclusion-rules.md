# Exclude meetings from analysis

Workplace Analytics uses email and calendar activities that are stored in a person's Office 365 account to reveal internal and external collaboration trends. However, a person's calendar and email can contain a diverse set of activities (such as personal meetings, work-related social activities, all-day training meetings, and so forth) that are not relevant to work-related collaboration, and, if included in the metrics, would skew query results.

Meeting exclusion rules are used in Workplace Analytics to help ensure that query results accurately represent relevant meeting norms within the organization. Workplace Analytics provides a default meeting exclusion rule that excludes a set of meetings that would commonly fall outside of relevant collaboration for analysis. Alternatively, analysts can use the meeting exclusion feature to create custom meeting exclusion rules. 

Multiple meeting exclusion rules can exist simultaneously. For information about how they are applied in Workplace Analytics, see [Application of meeting exclusion rules](#application-of-meeting-exclusion-rules).

## View meeting exclusions

This section describes how to view existing meeting exclusion rules. The section that follows describes how to author a new one. 

**To view existing meeting exclusion rules**

Open the Meeting exclusions page to view existing meeting exclusion rules or to create new ones. 

1. Open [Workplace  Analytics](https://workplaceanalytics.office.com/). If  prompted, enter your Microsoft credentials. 

2. Click **Queries** and then select the tab called **Meeting exclusions**. This opens the Meeting exclusions page. The page displays all meeting-exclusion rules that already exist: 

   * **System default:** Workplace Analytics supplies one meeting exclusion rule by default called **Default meeting exclusion rule**. This rule filters out meetings that are longer than 8 hours or whose number of attendees is 1 or fewer or 50 or more. This default rule is a good start, but if you were to use only it, you would miss the opportunity to verify that this rule didn't exclude any important meetings you wanted to keep, as well as the opportunity to exclude additional meetings based on meeting-subject keywords. 
   * **Your rules:** Rules that you have created.
   * **Others' rules:** Rules that other analysts have created.

>[!Note]
>Remember that you cannot edit any published meeting exclusion rules.

## Create meeting exclusions

A meeting exclusion rule is a filter applied to your meeting data. 

Defining what kind of meeting exclusion to use is part of the data-preparation work that an analyst must do before they start working with Workplace Analytics data. You can create these rules only after you've uploaded your organizational data. 

When you start a new meeting exclusion rule and before you have added any exclusions to it, the set of meetings that will be analyzed includes 100% of the meetings that were found in the Outlook mailboxes of licensed employees who use Office 365. As you add filter terms, or exclusions, to this exclusion rule, you gradually reduce the number of meetings and meeting hours that will be used in metrics calculations while performing analysis in Workplace Analytics.  

**Walkthrough: to add a meeting exclusion rule**

Workplace Analytics guides you step-by-step through the creation of a customized meeting exclusion rule. The meeting exclusion flow contains five steps, one for each type of meeting that is commonly excluded from analysis.

1. Open [Workplace Analytics](https://workplaceanalytics.office.com/). If prompted, enter your Microsoft credentials. 

2. Click **Queries** and then **Meeting exclusions**.

3. On the right side of the page, click **Add exclusion**. This opens the **Queries &gt; Meeting exclusions &gt; New meeting exclusion** page. This page displays a preview of the five types of meetings that are commonly excluded from analysis. In the steps that follow, you will have the chance to customize each of these exclusions. 

   You can choose to use the system-suggested exclusion on each step or customize the exclusion by retaining or excluding additional meetings. If you don't want to use a system-suggested exclusion, you can always choose not to apply the exclusion. After you have customized exclusions for each of the five steps, you can make edits to your exclusion rule before publishing it for future use.

4. Type a name for the  exclusion rule and, optionally, a description. Select **Next**. This starts the flow of steps in which you author your new exclusion rule by defining individual exclusions. 

<!-- Heading seems odd here: 
### Step-By-Step Overview 
<!-- Also formerly here: Why these rules?-->

5. **Step 1: Exclude cancelled meetings.** The first page in the flow is for excluding meetings that have been cancelled. On this page, you cannot change the default filter. Add this exclusion to your rule by clicking **Next **. Workplace Analytics displays the next page in the flow, the page for excluding small meetings.

6. **Step 2: Exclude small meetings.** Just as on the cancelled-meetings page, you cannot change the default filter for this exclusion. However, you can change the way it is applied by specifying exceptions to the exclusion. You do this by using the following parts of the page: [word cloud](#word-cloud), [keyword search](#keyword-search), [phrase table](#phrase-table). 

6.  When you have finished making exceptions to the small-meetings exclusion and you are ready to add the exclusion to the rule, click **Next**.

     Workplace Analytics displays the next step in the flow, the page for excluding large meetings. Notice that the values that are shown near the top of the page for Attendee meeting hours and Number of meetings have been lowered as a result of the exclusions that we've applied earlier in the last two pages.

7. **Step 3: Exclude large meetings.** This exclusion differs from the first two in that you can change the value in the "Exclude meetings where" filter from the default value of 250 attendees. 

8.  (Optional) Select words from the word cloud, inspect their impact in the **Phrases that contain the selected keyword** table, and designate one or more as exceptions to this exclusion. You can search for additional keywords or phrases that are not present in your word cloud by typing them in the search box above the phrase table.

   >[!Note] 
   > If you change the default filter value after you designate exceptions, the exceptions will be lost. 

10.  When you have finished making exceptions, click **Apply**.

11. **Step 4: Exclude long meetings.** To exclude meetings by duration, under **Exclude meetings where,** specify the maximum length of meetings that you want your analysis to include. The default value is 8 hours. 

12.  (Optional) Select words from the word cloud, inspect their impact in the **Phrases that contain the selected keyword** table, and designate one or more as exceptions to this exclusion.  You can search for additional keywords or phrases that are not present in your word cloud by typing them in the search box above the phrase table.

>[!Note] 
> If you change the default filter value after you designate exceptions, the exceptions will be lost.

13.  When you have finished making exceptions, click **Next**.

14. **Page 5: Exclude meetings by topic.** On this page, you use the subject lines of meetings to identify and exclude meetings that are not work related. The left side of the page lists several categories of common keywords, grouped by topic, that you can select for exclusion. 
Workplace Analytics also preselects some topics for you. For example, in the following illustration, **Administrative**, **Medical**, and **Out of Office** are selected for exclusion:

     ![Select topics to exclude](../images/wpa/tutorials/05-select-topics-to-exclude.png)
 
     Each topic that is listed under **List of topics** is also a tab. On an open tab, you can see keywords and phrases that relate to the topic. For example, the **Out of Office** tab contains the phrase "day off." These keywords are excluded from analysis. Click the â€˜X' of a keyword to delete it from this list. This exempts the keyword from exclusion; in other words, meetings whose subject line contains this keyword are removed from the exclusion and, therefore, available for analysis. 

     You might have a specific word or phrase in mind that you want to exclude from analysis; that is, to add to this exclusion. If it is not listed under Keywords, you can type it in the **Add a custom keyword** field. Phrases that you add here can be up to three words in length. All meetings associated with the keywords that you add in this step will be excluded from your analysis.

     This meetings-by-topic page also offers the **Phrases that contain the selected keyword** table and the functionality described in the step for creating a small-meetings exclusion. 

15. Select **Next**. Workplace Analytics now  calculates your new meeting-exclusion rule. This could take up to a few minutes.  
 
     After the calculation is finished, Workplace Analytics displays a cumulative summary of the exclusions that you defined on the five preceding steps. This summary explains the effect of your new rule, in particular, the percentages of original meeting hours and of meetings that remain to be analyzed:

     ![Rule summary overview](../images/wpa/tutorials/06-rule-summary-end.png)
 
     The summary lists which exclusions were applied, which ones were not applied, and the effects that each exclusion has. It also shows the cumulative impact of all exclusions on the meetings that remain in analysis. The table of rules shows the individual impact of each rule, so the total will likely not add up to 100%:

     ![Rule summary](../images/wpa/tutorials/07-summary-of-five.png)
 
16.  Examine this list of exclusions to make sure they retain the meetings that you want to keep in your analysis and exclude the ones that you want to exclude. If you want to change the settings of an exclusion, select the edit (pencil) icon to re-open that exclusion, and then edit its details. For example, you could re-open the long-meetings exclusion to change the threshold from 8 hours to 6. 

     **Reminder:** While making edits to an exclusion, if you change the default filter value after you designate exceptions, the exceptions will be lost. 

17.  After you have finished editing, select **Apply**. Workplace Analytics re-calculates the meeting-exclusion rule. After it finishes, if you have no more edits, scroll to the bottom of the summary page and select **Publish**. 

     >[!Important] 
     > * Your exclusion rule is not saved by default. It is saved only after you select **Publish**.
     > * After you select **Publish**, you can no longer edit the exclusion rule. 

     >[!Caution] 
     > * While you are authoring an exclusion rule (before you select **Publish**), _do not_ close your browser. Any work you've done to create a rule would be lost if you close the browser. 

After Workplace Analytics publishes your new rule, it displays a read-only summary of the rule's exclusions. 

## Select a rule

You can have one rule in effect at a time. For the rule in use on the Explore dashboards, see [Explore page](#explore-page). For the rule to be used in a query, see [Queries page](#queries-page).

### Use rules in the Explore dashboards

By default, the dashboards of the Explore page use the default meeting-exclusion rule that Workplace Analytics supplies, but you can change this to a different rule. The rule that will be used in the dashboards is known as the _preferred rule_, whether this is the default rule or a different rule that you've selected. 

**To apply a rule to a the Explore dashboards**

1.  In Workplace Analytics, open the **Queries** page.

2.  Select **Meeting exclusions**.

3.  In the list of rules, hover over the row of the rule you want to make the preferred rule. The words **Set preferred** appear, as shown here:

   ![Select an exclusion rule](../images/wpa/tutorials/19-choose-a-rule.png)
 
4.  Select **Set preferred**.

>[!Note] 
>If you select a new rule, the selection does not take effect until after the next time that your organization's Office 365 data is refreshed. The reason for this delay is that meeting-exclusion rules are applied to data before it is processed; after the data is uploaded and processed, rules can no longer be applied to it. Office 365 data is refreshed weekly, so it could take up to two weeks to see your rule in place, depending on the timing of your rule selection. 

### Use rules with queries

You can apply a meeting-exclusion rule to a query while you define the query.

>[!Note] 
>If you selected a rule as the preferred rule on the Meeting exclusions page, the rule that you selected also becomes your default rule when you work on the **Queries** page.
 
**To apply a rule to a query**

1.  In Workplace Analytics, open the Queries page.

2.  Select the rule you want from the Meeting exclusions list box, as shown here:

   ![Apply an exclusion to a query](../images/wpa/tutorials/20-apply-to-query.png)
