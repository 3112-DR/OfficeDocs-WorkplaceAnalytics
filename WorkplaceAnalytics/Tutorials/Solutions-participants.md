# Teamwork solution: The experience of program participants

**Role** - participant in a habit-change program, an information worker who is using MyAnalytics

While analysts and program managers create and manage programs in Workplace Analytics, the actual work of change is done by MyAnalytics users. These are the people for whom a need was identified and a program created. They have the opportunity to change workplace habits for the better.

After a program is scheduled, these program participants receive an automatically generated welcome email from Workplace Analytics. It explains the details of the program: its duration and goals, and the habits they're expected to work on. The participants' MyAnalytics dashboards are enhanced with program information that shows recommended habits and their progress against the program goals. They also receive a weekly email digest that summarizes their progress in the program.

**Material for participants: Examples**

During a program, participants receive or can view the following items:

## At program start

### Welcome email

The [welcome email](../Images/WpA/Tutorials/welcome-msg-prog-partic.png) is sent to participants at the start of the program.  

## Throughout the program

### MyAnalytics dashboard

The [MyAnalytics dashboard](../MyAnalytics/use/dashboard-2.md) is a constantly available resource for your users. In addition to its standard content, the dashboard also includes a participant section during a program, similar to the following:

### MyAnalytics inline suggestions

MyAnalytics inline suggestions in Outlook are brief, data- and AI-driven notifications that appear in Outlook while you are either reading or composing an email or a meeting invitation. Different inline suggestions apply to different situations. For example, if you have outstanding to-do tasks, an inline suggestion might ask whether you want to review them. 

While many inline suggestions are available to all MyAnalytics participants, some apply only to participants of particular Teamwork solution plans, as described in the following tables: 

#### Collaboration plan

Participants in the Collaboration plan might see the following inline suggestions:

| Where it shows up  | What it says | How it helps  |
|------|-------|---------|
|Reading pane (meeting invitation) 	| Could this meeting be 45 minutes? Suggest shortening to save everyone one hour per month. **Reply to &lt;name&gt;** | Suggests that you ask the meeting organizer to shorten hour-long meetings to 45 minutes. |

| Where it shows up  | What it says | How it helps  |
|------|-------|---------|
|Meeting compose	| Some attendees have a lot of meetings this week. Is everyone required? **Mark whoâ€™s optional**  | Suggests that you reconsider whether everyone is required in the meeting that you are organizing, due to the high meeting load of your invitees. |

#### Wellbeing plan

Participants in the Wellbeing plan might see the following inline suggestion:

| Where it shows up  | What it says | How it helps  |
|------|-------|---------|
|Reading pane (meeting invitation)  | Looks like this meeting is outside your typical working hours. Here are some alternate times that work for everyone. **See suggested times** | Suggests that you ask the organizer to move the meeting to a time during working hours that works for all attendees. |
