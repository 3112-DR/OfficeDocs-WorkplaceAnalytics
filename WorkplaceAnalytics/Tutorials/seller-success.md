# Seller success solution

Sales departments are the most profitable for any company, but their effectiveness can be unpredictable because of the variability in how salespeople work. With this in mind, Workplace Analytics offers the seller success solution. Its purpose is to help sales organizations learn more about the behaviors that differentiate their most successful salespeople, and build plans that help salespeople acquire those behaviors. 

It’s not the purpose of the seller success solution to make sellers more productive simply by giving them more data. Rather, it aims to encourage sellers to reflect on how they use their limited time, and to make decisions that align their use of time with the company’s strategic priorities. 

The solution displays insights to help salespeople optimally use their limited time to maximize productivity, conversion rates, and sales revenues. In this case, productivity is defined as spending more time with the right set of customers, leveraging internal networks, and involving their manager and leadership in strategic customer meetings, as needed.

### Roles

To be able to perform the following tasks, you must have either the analyst or limited analyst role of Workplace Analytics. 

## Create a seller success plan 

**Prerequisite:** To create a seller success plan, you must have CRM data uploaded. For more information, see [CRM data in Workplace Analytics](../setup/crm-data-upload.md).

Complete the following tasks to create and run a seller success plan: 

 * [Create the plan](#create-the-plan): Take the initial steps to create a plan.  
 * [Select participants](#select-participants): Select participants for the plan either by uploading a .csv file or by using filters.
 * [Start the plan](#start-the-plan): After your list of participants has been validated, start the plan for them.

### Create the plan 

1.	Open [Workplace Analytics](https://workplaceanalytics.office.com/). If prompted, sign in with your work account. 

2.	In the left navigation pane, select **Solutions**. 

3.	On the **Solutions** page, under **Available plans**, on the **Seller success** card, select **Start now**. 
 
    ![Solutions main page](../images/wpa/tutorials/solutions-main-page-w-highlight.png)

    The **Seller success plan** page opens: 

    ![New Seller success plan](../images/wpa/tutorials/set-up-new-seller-plan.png)
 
4.	(Optional) Change the plan name from the default name. 

5.	Go to [Select participants](#select-participants). 

### Select participants

If you have a particular group in mind, you can identify the group in either of the following ways: 

 * [Upload a .csv file](#upload-a-csv-file) 
 * [Use filters](#use-filters)

#### Upload a .csv file

**Prerequisite:** A .csv file that lists the employees you want to participate in the plan. The format of this file is simple: a list of email addresses in a single column. To obtain this file, you might have exported it from an HR system. 

1.	Obtain the .csv file to upload.
2.	Select **Upload .csv file**.
3.	Select **Browse**, select a .csv file, and then select **Open**. 
4.	After the file has been uploaded, select **Validate**.

    Workplace Analytics validates each potential participant. Workplace Analytics reports whether the group successfully validated, and it also displays any warnings that are generated. For more information, see [Validation](#validation). 

5.	After the group validates successfully and the number of participants meets or exceeds the minimum group size, you can proceed with the group that you selected. Go to [Start the plan](#start-the-plan).

#### Use filters

1.	Select **Use filters**.

2.	Add filters to define your group. For example, select **Organization**, **Equals**, and **Sales** in the fields to select the people who work in sales as your group. 

    Optionally, add more function types to expand this group, or add more filtering criteria to refine the selection: 

    ![Use filters to find group](../images/wpa/tutorials/seller-plan-filters.png)

3.	After you have selected the group(s) of participants, select **Validate**.
  
    Workplace Analytics validates each potential participant. Workplace Analytics reports whether the group successfully validated, and it also displays any warnings that are generated. For more information, see [Validation](#validation).

4.	After the group validates successfully and the number of participants meets or exceeds the minimum group size, you can proceed with the group that you selected. Go to [Start the plan](#start-the-plan). 

### Start the plan

1.	(Optional) Change the dates of the **Plan duration**. Do this by editing the start date of the plan. 

2.	Select **Create plan**. This starts the plan for the plan participants. For an overview of their experience, see [Participant experience](#participant-experience).

## Email for participants

After the plan is started, the participants of a Seller success plan receive a tailored email. It starts out by summarizing to the salesperson how they spent their time in internal and external collaboration during the preceding week:

![Email top](../images/wpa/tutorials/email-top.png)

### Email structure

This email can contain any of several descriptive cards, each of which is designed to help the participants work more effectively:

 * [Time with customers](#time-with-customers)
 * [Depth of engagement](#depth-of-engagement)
 * [Leverage internal networks](#leverage-internal-networks)
 * [Connect with leadership](#connect-with-leadership)

### Use the seller success email

The seller success email contains several cards, each of which offers a targeted suggestion. In three of the cards, the **Suggestion** section contains an **Explore** option that you can select to learn more about this suggestion and how it can be of benefit. 

The fourth card, [Connect with leadership](#connect-with-leadership), has a **Manage meetings** option. Select **Manage meetings** to view your upcoming meetings in the Outlook web calendar and, optionally, to make changes to those meetings.    

## Email cards

Depending on the recent available collaboration data, the Seller success participant email will contain any or all of the following informative cards. 

### Time with customers

The _Time with customers_ card displays how you spent your time with your customers over the past seven days. Its chart reflects total collaboration hours with each customer.

Its purpose is to help you decide whether you are spending time optimally with customers according to their respective potential. 

![Time with customers](../images/wpa/tutorials/time-with-customers.png)
 
On this card, select **Explore** to open the **Network** page of the MyAnalytics personal dashboard to see more details about how (with whom) you spent your time. 

### Depth of engagement

In the _Depth of engagement_ section, the **People you engaged with** column shows the number of distinct people in the account with which you had one or more meaningful interaction in last 28 days.

![Depth of engagement](../images/wpa/tutorials/depth-of-engagement.png)
 
On this card, select **Explore** to open the **Network** page of the MyAnalytics personal dashboard to see more details about how (with whom) you spent your time. 

### Leverage internal networks

Being connected with the right individuals and organizations within the company can help overall performance. The _Leverage internal networks_ card displays the number of hours you collaborated with particular internal groups. It calls your attention to these figures so that you can improve your depth of customer engagement by strengthening your internal networks.

![Leverage internal networks](../images/wpa/tutorials/leverage-internal-networks.png)
 
On this card, select **Explore** to open the **Network** page of the MyAnalytics personal dashboard to see more details about how (with whom) you spent your time. 

### Connect with leadership

Spending time with and getting attention from your manager and other senior people in your own organization is important for the success of salespeople. The chart on the _Connect with leadership_ card displays the time the salesperson spent with their manager (or “leadership,” managers above their immediate manager) in meetings with particular customers.

![Connect with leadership](../images/wpa/tutorials/connect-with-leadership.png)
 
On this card, select **Manage meetings** to open the [calendar week view of Outlook](https://outlook.office.com/calendar/view/week). 

### Privacy note

The data that you see in the seller success email is your own data and only you have access to it. Your manager, your admin, and your teammates cannot see it. As is stated at the top of the email, this data is for your eyes only. For more information, see [Data privacy in Workplace Analytics](#data-privacy-in-workplace-analytics).

# Concepts

This section describes concepts that can help you as you create and use seller success plans in Workplace Analytics. 

## Validation

After you select **Validate**, Workplace Analytics checks for licenses of potential plan participants. Participants must have both a MyAnalytics license and a Workplace Analytics license. If the user is missing either license, or has opted out of MyA, an error is generated and displayed for that user. That user is then removed from the list of potential plan participants. 

After the validation checks have run, if the final list of participants has enough people to meet or exceed the [minimum group size]() set for the organization, you can continue to use this group in creating your plan. 

## Data privacy in Workplace Analytics

Workplace Analytics operates under the following privacy principles:

 * [You own the data in your inbox](#you-own-the-data-in-your-inbox)
 * [No one but you sees your data](#no-one-but-you-sees-your-data)

### You own the data in your inbox

When you look in your Office 365 mailbox, you see a record of interactions that you’ve had with other people. These interactions are of various kinds: emails that you’ve sent and received, meeting invitations, chats and calls. Because it’s your mailbox, you have a right to access it and view the information that it contains. In other words, your mailbox content is information that’s freely available to you.

Most of the interactions in your mailbox involve other people – for example, co-workers who’ve sent you emails or meeting invitations or received them from you. These interactions provide you with a bit of information about how those co-workers used the communication tools of Office 365. If you want to know how many emails your manager sent you last month (eight, let’s say), you probably wouldn’t ask her. Instead, you open your Outlook inbox, sort it by sender, and count.

The fact that those eight emails were sent by your manager doesn’t mean that this metadata about them (the count of emails) belongs only to her. It also belongs to you, because you received these emails.
If you send an email to your IT person, you can assume he’ll know that you sent it, and when. Sending it means that you’ve chosen to reveal it (both its contents and its metadata) to him.

**Conclusion:** What's in your inbox is yours. Your right to view the items in your inbox supersedes any other person’s right to privacy over those items.

### No one but you sees your data

Let’s say you want to dig deeper into what’s in your inbox. For example, how many emails did you send to your co-workers in your off-work hours last week? How many did you send the week before, and the week before that?

You might want to uncover trends. Did you work more in your off hours before the winter break or after it? This sort of question is answered through analysis. That is where analytical tools such as Workplace Analytics can play a role.

This tool looks in your inbox and in your calendar, crunches numbers, and gives insight into your behavior: How many emails did you send? How many meetings did you attend? Considering your emails and your meetings, how much time did you spend with customers? How many contacts did you have with each customer?

Rather than having to open your mailbox folders and count items, or open your calendar and add up meeting times, you can see data of this sort summarized in the seller-solution email summary provided by Workplace Analytics. 

**Conclusion:** Only you can see your Workplace Analytics data. Workplace Analytics insights are derived from data that was already available to you in your inbox.
