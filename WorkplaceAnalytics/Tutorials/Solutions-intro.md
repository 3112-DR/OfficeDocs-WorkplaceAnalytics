# Workplace Analytics solutions

By combining the power of Workplace Analytics and MyAnalytics, solutions help you transform insights from Workplace Analytics into targeted change programs across your organization. Targeted change programs are available for reducing meeting load, increasing focus time, and maintaining work-life balance. By using the solutions feature, you can do the following:

1. Use Workplace Analytics to identify groups that are experiencing meeting load, lack of focus time, or lack of work-life balance. 
2. Set up 12-week change programs for the identified groups with goals, recommended habits, and additional context. The members of the group experience the change program through MyAnalytics. 
3. Measure the progress of the program while it is underway, and the ROI of the program after it has finished. 

For more information about the real-world change programs that solutions enables, see [Learn how Macy's uses Workplace Analytics and MyAnalytics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZeTkK65RQM). <!-- and [[Helen's video]]. -->

## Prerequisites for using solutions

Here are the prerequisites for using solutions: 

 * Obtain licenses to both Workplace Analytics and MyAnalytics for the groups that will experience change programs. 
 * Identify people in your organization to whom to assign the following roles: 
    * <u>Analyst.</u> Analysts help identify opportunities for change programs.  
    * <u>Program manager.</u> Program managers help set up and run programs, and measure program ROI. 

   > [!Note] 
   > One person can be assigned both the Analyst and Program manager roles.

## Solutions: Frequently asked questions

### Questions about roles and access

**Question 1:** Why don't I see the solutions area?

**Answer 1:** You can see the solutions area only if you've been assigned the role of program manager or the role of analyst. 

**Question 2:** Why do I see the Identify page but not the Manage and Track pages?

**Answer 2:** You can see the Manage and Track pages only if you've been assigned the role of program manager. 

**Question 3:** What is the role of a program manager? Why do we need a new role?

**Answer 3:** A program manager understands teams and trends in an organization and can define, track, and understand the value of programs. 

#### Additional information about roles and access

 * For more information about assigning roles, see [Assign roles to Workplace Analytics admins and analysts](../setup/set-up-workplace-analytics.md#step-3-assign-roles-to-workplace-analytics-admins-and-analysts).

### Questions about program implementation

**Question 4:** Can we change the duration of the programs?

**Answer 4:** No. All programs last twelve weeks. Exception: Occasionally, a program must be ended early because of unforseen circumstances. 

**Question 5:** What is the minimum group size?

**Answer 5:** On the Settings page of Workplace Analytics, administrators can set the minimum group size for an organization. They cannot reduce this setting below the absolute limit (five people). For more information, see [Configure settings for Workplace Analytics](../use/settings.md). 

**Question 6:** Can I monitor metrics of specific users?

**Answer 6:** No. Privacy considerations preclude the monitoring of behavior information about specific users.
