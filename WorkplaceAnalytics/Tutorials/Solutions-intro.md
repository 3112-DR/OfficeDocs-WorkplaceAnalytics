# Solutions: introduction

Use the Solutions area of Workplace Analytics to attempt to change employees' work habits for the better. On the Solutions pages of Workplace Analytics, you can create a program, track it while it is in progress, and examine it after it completes. 

For a step-by-step walkthrough that uses the capabilities of Solutions feature to create a program, see [Solutions: walkthrough](solutions-task.md).  

## Executive summary

The Solutions feature of Workplace Analytics combines the power of Workplace Analytics and MyAnalytics to enable you to transform the insights you find in Workplace Analytics into targeted change programs across your organization. The first set of change programs that are supported in Solutions are reducing meeting load, increasing focus time, and maintaining work-life balance. In the future, additional solutions types will become available.

The Solutions feature works like this:

1. It helps you identify in Workplace Analytics groups that are experiencing meeting load, lack of focus time, or lack of work-life balance. 

2. It enables you to set up 12-week change programs for the identified groups with goals, recommended habits, and additional context. The members of the group experience the change program through MyAnalytics. 

3. Finally, it helps you measure progress and the ROI of the program. 
Solutions combines the features of real-world change programs that are run with in Workplace Analytics and MyAnalytics. For more information, see [[Macy`s video]] and [[Helen's video]].
