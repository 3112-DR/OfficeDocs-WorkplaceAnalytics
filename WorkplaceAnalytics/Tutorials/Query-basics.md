# Queries overview

You can create four types of queries in Workplace Analytics: **Person**, **Meeting**, **Group-to-group**, and **Person-to-group**. Each query type can help answer specific questions you want to investigate. The different query types give you flexibility to look at data from multiple perspectives and generate powerful insights. You can also use the query types together to gain even more in-depth insights.

With these queries, you can:

* Select as many or as few metrics as you need, for any population or time range.
* Customize metrics with a broad range of interaction details.
* Get your data in a clean and easy-to-use format that can take your analysis to the next level.

## Person query

Use a person query when you want to understand the relationship between a person’s organizational attributes (their team, level, or location) and how they use their time, or when you want to know how one aspect of a person’s use of time might influence another aspect of their time use.

With a person query you can compare across individual activities and attributes, such as:

* Time-use metrics
* Organizational attributes

## Meeting query  

Use a meeting query when you want to understand the relationship between different meeting attributes.

With a meeting query you can compare across meeting attributes, such as:

* Size or duration
* Subject line keywords
* Double-booked or multitasking rates
* Meeting organizer attributes

## Group-to-group query

Use a group-to-group query when you want to understand how one team invested their collaboration time across other teams within and outside of the organization.

For this query type, you can define a team in a variety of ways, with any organizational attribute or email domain. This enables you to answer questions such as:

* How did _Sales managers_ allocate their time between all external _customer domains_ (companies)?
* How much time did _Benefits Analysts_ spend with _individual contributors_ in each _region_?
* How did _Corporate VPs_ allocate their time to _managers_ by _business unit_?

Group-to-group queries also offer alternative perspectives on collaboration. Rather than allocating collaboration hours across other teams, you can analyze the number of interactions between the teams, or analyze only those collaboration activities initiated by the “time giver” team.

## Person-to-group query

Use a person-to-group query to help you understand how individuals invested their time with one or more collaborator teams within and outside of the organization.

Similar to a group-to-group query, you can define the person (or time investor) and that person's collaborator team or teams in a variety of ways, with any organizational attribute or email domain.

You can choose to analyze the number of interactions between a time investor and the defined collaboration team, or analyze only those collaboration activities initiated by the specified time investor.
