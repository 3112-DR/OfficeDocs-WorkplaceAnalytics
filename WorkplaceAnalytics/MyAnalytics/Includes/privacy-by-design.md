The Outlook add-in preserves all the data subject rights afforded by GDPR. The insights users see in the add-in are only available to them. No admin or manager can see those insights. They are computed on the fly based on the user's email and meeting information, and are never stored outside the user's mailbox. Additionally, the add-in begins processing data for insights only when the user first launches it.
