To select (or deselect) all sections at once, select or clear **Select All** at the top of the dashboard. 

You can choose not to share one or more statistics by deselecting the cards in a section. 

<p></p>

<li>After you've chosen all the statistics that you want to share, select **Confirm** at the top of your dashboard. This displays a dialog box in which you can choose recipients, type a subject line, and compose a note to your recipients. All three fields (recipients, subject line, and message) are required.</li>
<li>When you're ready to send the message and share your statistics, select **Share**. A dialog box confirms that “Your statistics are on the way.”</li>
</ol>
