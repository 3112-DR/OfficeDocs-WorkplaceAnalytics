**To share statistics**

1. Open the MyAnalytics dashboard.
2. Select the **Share** icon in the upper-right corner of the page.

   The dashboard displays sections that are available for sharing. By default, all available sections are selected for sharing.

3. Select (or deselect) a section to share it. Two indicators show which sections are selected for sharing:

   * The box at the top of the section is selected.
   * The outline of the section is blue, not gray.

    In the following illustration, the Meeting hours section is selected, while Meeting habits is not selected:

    To select (or deselect) all sections at once, select or clear **Select All** at the top of the dashboard.

   You can choose not to share one or more statistics by deselecting the cards in a section.

4. After you've chosen all the statistics that you want to share, select **Confirm** at the top of your dashboard. This displays a dialog box in which you can choose recipients, type a subject line, and compose a note to your recipients. All three fields (recipients, subject line, and message) are required.

5. When you're ready to send the message and share your statistics, select **Share**. A message confirms that "Your statistics are on the way."
