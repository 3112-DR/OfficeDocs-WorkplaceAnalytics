**To remove a person from your Important people list**
1. In Microsoft Delve, open your MyAnalytics dashboard.  
2. Under Network, in the Your time investments area, click **All**.  
3. Switch to map view.  
4. In the map, click the picture of the person you want to remove from the list. This person’s card appears to the right of the map. 
5. In the person’s card, click **Remove from important**. In the map, the star is removed from the person’s picture. This indicates that the person is no longer on the list.
