   > If you see a "Welcome!" message, select **Get started**.

2. On the **Insights** panel, locate the **Track email open rates** card:

3. This card lets you see more information about recent emails that you've sent. To see this information, select the **Track email open rates** card.

4. The panel displays insight cards for each of these recently sent messages These cards state the subject line, a brief summary of the open rate, the open rate (sometimes expressed as a percentage), and the number of forwards.

<!--
    Based on the length of the message, Insights estimates how long a person needs to read it. It uses that number to decide whether people glanced, skimmed, or read the email, and informs you of this in a card.

    Depending on how many people opened the email and how long they spent reading it, Insights might suggest that you follow up on your email, or it might show tips to help improve email communication.
