**To see information about a specific email message**

1. In your **Sent Items** folder in Outlook, select the email message.  
2. On the **Message** ribbon, select the **Insights** icon. If the Insights panel isn't already open, it opens now. At the top of the panel, a card displays information about the email. For example, the following shows the message status for the "Document for review" (email subject line):

    ![Track email open rates](../../Images/mya/use/track-email-open-rates.png)

3. To see more information about this message, select the card. For the selected message, a chart shows the percentage of recipients who opened the email, and the number of times people replied to it and forwarded it.

    ![Email open rates](../../Images/mya/use/email-open-rates-2.png)

    Based on the length of the message, Insights estimates how long a person needs to read it. It uses that number to decide whether people glanced, skimmed, or read the email, and informs you of this in a card.

    Depending on how many people opened the email and how long they spent reading it, Insights might suggest that you follow up on your email, or it might show tips to help improve email communication.
