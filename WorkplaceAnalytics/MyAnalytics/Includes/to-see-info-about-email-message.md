**To see read information about sent emails**

1. On the **Home** ribbon, select the **Insights** icon. If the Insights panel isn't already open, it opens now. 

   > [!Note] 
   > If you see a "Welcome!" message, select **Get started**.

2. On the **Insights** panel, select one of the following two cards:

   a. **In-context email open rate**. This card provides read statistics for the sent email that you currently have open in Outlook.

   b. The **Track email open rates** card. This card provides read statistics for all sent emails.  

     ![Track email open rates](../../Images/mya/use/step-1-track-open-rates.png)

    The panel in the card that you selected (in either step 2a. or step 2b.) states the email subject line and shows a summary of the open rate, the open rate (sometimes expressed as a percentage), and the number of forwards.

### Read statistics details

Note the following about the reporting of read-statistics data: 

 * **Length of availability.** Read statistics for an email are present only for a period of 14 days. (Read statistics are not computed for mails that have been sent more than 14 days ago.)
 * **Time until availability.** It usually takes 15 to 30 minutes to compute precise results for read statistics for your emails.
 * **Five-recipient limit.** An email qualifies for read statistics only if it was sent to more than five recipients in the _To_, _Cc_ and _Bcc_ fields combined.

<!--
    Based on the length of the message, Insights estimates how long a person needs to read it. It uses that number to decide whether people glanced, skimmed, or read the email, and informs you of this in a card.

    Depending on how many people opened the email and how long they spent reading it, Insights might suggest that you follow up on your email, or it might show tips to help improve email communication.
