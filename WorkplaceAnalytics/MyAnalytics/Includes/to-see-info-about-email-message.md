**To see read information about sent emails**

1. On the **Home** ribbon, select the **Insights** icon. If the Insights panel isn't already open, it opens now. 

   > [!Note] 
   > If you see a "Welcome!" message, select **Get started**.

2. On the **Insights** panel, select one of the following two cards:

   a. **In-context email open rate**. This card provides read statistics for the one sent email that currently has focus in Outlook.

   b. The **Track email open rates** card. This card provides read statistics for all other sent emails.

3. To see read statistics, select the appropriate card.

   a. If you selected the **In-context email open rate** card, the panel displays read statistics for the sent email that currently has focus in Outlook. The panel states the subject line and shows a summary of the open rate, the open rate (sometimes expressed as a percentage), and the number of forwards.

   b. If you selected the **Track email open rates** card, the panel displays insights cards for each of your recently sent messages. These cards state the subject line, a brief summary of the open rate, the open rate (sometimes expressed as a percentage), and the number of forwards.

### Read statistics details

Note the following about the reporting of read-statistics data: 

 * **Length of availability.** Read Statistics for an email are present only for a period of 14 days. (Read Statistics are not computed for mails that have been sent more than 14 days ago.)
 * **Time until availability.** It usually takes 15 to 30 minutes to compute precise results for read statistics for your emails.
 * **Five-recipient limit.** An email qualifies for read statistics only if it was sent to more than five recipients in the _To_, _Cc_ and _Bcc_ fields combined. 


<!--
    Based on the length of the message, Insights estimates how long a person needs to read it. It uses that number to decide whether people glanced, skimmed, or read the email, and informs you of this in a card.

    Depending on how many people opened the email and how long they spent reading it, Insights might suggest that you follow up on your email, or it might show tips to help improve email communication.
