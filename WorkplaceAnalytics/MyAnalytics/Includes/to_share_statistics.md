The dashboard displays sections that are available for sharing. By default, all available sections are selected for sharing.

<ul>

<br/>

To select (or deselect) all sections at once, check or clear the Select All checkbox at the top of the dashboard. 

You can choose not to share one or more statistics by deselecting the cards of a section. 

<li>After you've chosen all the statistics that you want to share, click Confirm at the top of your dashboard. This displays a dialog box in which you can choose recipients, type a subject line, and compose a note to your recipients. All three fields (recipients, subject line, and message) are required.</li>
<li>When you're ready to send the message and share your statistics, click **Share**. A dialog box confirms that “Your statistics are on the way.”</li>
</ol>
