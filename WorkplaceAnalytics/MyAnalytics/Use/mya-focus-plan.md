# MyAnalytics focus plan

Meetings, emails, and chats are necessary to get work done, but they often leave us with little time during the work day for uninterrupted individual work. Some people report spending over 80% of their day collaborating with coworkers, and research has shown that it can take over 20 minutes to refocus after checking just one email.

The focus plan in MyAnalytics helps you block time every day for your top-priority work. . MyAnalytics will help you reserve 1-2 hours every day to focus (with the option to automatically book that time), and silence chats during that booked time. 

The focus plan of MyAnalytics is tied to the focus theme, or work pattern. (For more information about the MyAnalytics Focus work pattern, see [Focus](../use/focus.md).) 
As a MyAnalytics participant, you can choose to create or to end your focus plan at will. For more information, see [To create your focus plan](#to-create-your-focus-plan) and [To leave or change your focus plan](#to-leave-or-change-your-focus-plan). 

You can at any time create a focus plan, check your progress, or leave the plan, as described in the following sections.

## To create your focus plan

You create your focus plan in the MyAnalytics dashboard.

1. Open the MyAnalytics dashboard. You can do that in the following ways:

   * Go to [myanalytics.microsoft.com](https://myanalytics.microsoft.com).
   * In Microsoft Outlook, in the Insights pane, select the _Go to dashboard_ icon:

     ![Go to dashaboard](../../Images/mya/use/go-to-dashboard.png) 

   * In the focus plan card in the email digest, select **Try it out**.  
   * In the Insights add-in in Outlook, select the **Create your focus plan** card.

    This opens the MyAnalytics dashboard, where you can indicate your preferences:

    ![Personalize your experience](../../Images/mya/use/preferences.png)
 
    On this page, select either **Book time for me** or **Just remind me to book time**. If you select the former, MyAnalytics will automatically add one to two hours of focus time per day on your Outlook calendar, depending on what time your calendar has open. If you select the latter option, MyAnalytics will remind you to schedule your own focus time. 

2.	Select **Get started**. This enrolls you in a focus plan. MyAnalytics now carries out the option that you chose – to book focus time or to remind you to book focus time.
 
    If you selected **Book time for me**, you will notice blocks of focus time after they appear on your Outlook calendar. For more information, see [Automatic focus-time booking](#automatic-focus-time-booking).

<!-- PeterB said we don't need this. Just say what's in the note immediately preceding. 
 
#### Outlook add-in

1.	In the Outlook add-in, click the **Create your focus plan** card:
 
    This opens the **Build your focus plan** card:
 
2.	Select either **Book time for me** or **Reminders only**. If you select the former, MyAnalytics will automatically add one to two hours of focus time per day on your Outlook calendar, depending on what time your calendar has open. If you select **Reminders only**, MyAnalytics will remind you to schedule your own focus time. 

3.	Select **Get started**. This enrolls you in a focus plan. MyAnalytics now carries out the option that you chose – to book focus time or to remind you to book focus time. 

If you selected **Book time for me**, you will notice blocks of focus time after they appear on your Outlook calendar. For more information, see [Automatic focus-time booking](#automatic-focus-time-booking).

## To check the progress of your focus plan

After your plan has started, you can check your progress and make sure that you have focus time booked every day over the upcoming two weeks. If the plan has run for at least few days, it will have numbers to report. 

 * In the MyAnalytics dashboard, select **Focus** in the left navigation pane. A panel opens up to display statistics about your focus time:

    ![Dashboard report](../../Images/mya/use/dashboard-report.png)
  
An important metric on this page is displayed under **Last week stats**. It shows how many days you had focus time last week. 

The **Plan ahead** area helps you to plan focus time for the upcoming days. This area has the following sections: 

### Focus time booked

For the current week and the following week, see how many (four in the preceding example screenshot) and which days have had focus time booked. The shapes in this area are color coded:

| Color | Meaning |
| ----- | ----- |
| Green | 	On this day, focus time was booked. Either MyAnalytics booked it automatically or you responded to a MyAnalytics reminder to book focus time. |
| Gray | A weekend or working day that has already passed. |
| Yellow | There’s a meeting conflict with your booked focus time, or MyAnalytics couldn’t find any time to book on that day to a packed schedule. |
| Blue | You haven’t yet booked focus time on that day, but MyAnalytics found open time that’s available to book. | 

### Needs focus time

This section shows upcoming days that have no focus time booked but still have open time available. Select **Book now** to have MyAnalytics select and book this time. 

### Needs review

During the number of days shown (in the screenshot, three days) MyAnalytics has either found no time to book or it has found booked focus time that has a meeting conflict. Select **Review** to open your calendar in Outlook on the web to resolve the issue. 

> [!Note] 
> If you make changes to your Outlook calendar, they are reflected when you refresh or return to this page. For example, MyAnalytics has booked focus time for you for tomorrow. You then open your calendar and delete that focus time. If you then return to this page, it will indicate the new free time in the Focus time booked area. It will also re-book that time if you select **Book now**, or show you that time&mdash;potential focus time, again&mdash;in your Outlook calendar, if you select **Review**. 

## To leave or change your focus plan

You can opt in and opt out of the focus plan as many times as you want. 

1.	Select **Plan configuration**:

    ![Plan configuration](../../Images/mya/use/plan-config.png)
 
    This opens the **Configurations** page and displays the **Plan configuration** card.

2.	Your status determines what you see on the **Plan configuration** card: 

    * <u>Already in a plan:</u> If you are already in a focus plan, the card gives you two options: 
       * To change your plan preference, select the option to switch between auto-booking and reminders, and then select **Save changes**. 

         ![Personalize your experience](../../Images/mya/use/plan-config-card.png)

       * To end your participation in the focus plan, select **Leave plan** and then respond **Yes** or **No** in the **Leave focus plan** confirmation message. 

    * <u>Not in a plan:</u> If you are not already in a focus plan, the **Plan configuration** card gives you the option to join. To do this, select **Try it now**. This displays the **Personalize your experience** card. 

       On this card, select either **Book time for me** or **Just remind me to book time**, and then select **Get started**.

# Concepts

The following sections provide information that can help you as you create or monitor focus plans.  

## Automatic focus-time booking

After you set automatic booking as your preference, MyAnalytics starts looking for time on your Outlook calendar to set aside as focus time. The time that it books on your calendar appears in a different color and is labeled "Focus time":  

![Focus prompt in the email digest](../../Images/mya/use/focus-time-on-your-calendar.png)

Focus time never creates a calendar conflict; that is, focus time will not be booked over any existing calendar event, such as all-day meetings, booked personal time, or appointments. 

Although two hours is the maximum length of a focus-time block that can be scheduled automatically, you can extend your focus time, by hand, in your Outlook calendar. 

### Booking schedule

MyAnalytics books focus time two weeks in advance. For example: when you open your calendar on a Monday, you should see focus time booked every day of the current week and all the way through the Friday of the following week. Each weekend it looks for time blocks in the next week out and books time accordingly. 

### How time slots are selected

The time it reserves for you depends on what you have open during the day. MyAnalytics starts its search at the beginning of your workday, as it is defined in your Outlook settings. If your day starts at 8:00 AM and you have two hours open right then, MyAnalytics schedules two hours of focus time, from 8:00 to 10:00 AM. If it finds no open time at the beginning of your day, it continues to scan your calendar to find open blocks later in the day. If only smaller amounts of time are available, it can book a focus block as short as one hour. 

After it books a block on one day, it then moves on to the next day to find the next suitable block. (In most cases, it creates only one block of focus time per day.)

### Lunchtime

MyAnalytics considers the time from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM as time for the midday meal. If you have auto-booking turned on, MyAnalytics tries to book any other time of day first. If it finds no other blocks of time available, it will then book focus time during the lunchtime period. 

### Chats are muted during focus time  

When your focus time starts, your status in Teams and Skype for Business will automatically change to "Do not disturb."

## Focus plan in MyAnalytics surfaces

### Before you create the plan

As a MyAnalytics user, you might become aware of the focus plan when you see focus-related prompts and messages in the weekly digest email, the dashboard, and insights. Examples: 

#### Focus plan prompt in the email digest

![Focus prompt in the email digest](../../Images/mya/use/focus-prompt-in-email-digest-75-90.png)

#### Focus plan prompt in the dashboard
  
![Focus prompt in the dashboard](../../Images/mya/use/focus-prompt-in-dashboard.png)

For more information about the digest email, which for focus plan participants becomes tailored to the plan, see [MyAnalytics weekly digest email](#myanalytics-weekly-digest-email). 

#### Inline suggestions and other alerts

If you've chosen not to turn on auto-booking and if other circumstances arise that will limit your focus time (even if you choose to delete a focus block), MyAnalytics alerts you of the focus time that you are missing over the upcoming days. 

For example, the add-in might display this card: 
 
![Add-in feed card](../../Images/mya/use/add-in-feed-card.png)

Select that card to see the following options to book focus time on individual days or several days at once:  

![Book focus time inline](../../Images/mya/use/book-focus-time-nudge.png)

### After you create the plan
 
#### MyAnalytics weekly digest email

As described under [To check the progress of your focus plan](#to-check-the-progress-of-your-focus-plan), you use the MyAnalytics dashboard to see how well your focus plan is working. 

You can also find similar information in the MyAnalytics weekly digest email. After you enroll in a focus plan, the content of the digest email becomes tailored to your participation in the plan. 

It reports on your recent progress in the plan, it gives opportunities to plan for the near future, and it presents food-for-thought items that can help you succeed in the plan. Finally, it contains an _Explore more_ section that lets you dig deeper into various performance indicators for recent days. It looks something like this:
