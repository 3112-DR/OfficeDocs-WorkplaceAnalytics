## To do card

MyAnalytics can remind you to do tasks that are called out in email messages. In an automatic process, MyAnalytics finds instances in which a task is promised or requested, such as the following:  

* An email you sent generates a To-do card for you if it contains a statement such as “I will send you the plans.” 
* An email you received generates a To-do card for you if it contains a statement such as “Please review the highlighted items.”  

If you have one or more of these automatically generated tasks, a summary card is displayed in the MyAnalytics pane:  

<img src="../../../Images/mya/use/To-do-page-1.PNG" alt="To-do card">


> [!Note] 
> The To-do card is available only in English. 


[!INCLUDE [Get more details about to-do items](../../Includes/to-get-more-details.md)]

To mark a to-do item as done, click **Mark as done**. To-do cards disappear after two weeks or after you mark them as done.
