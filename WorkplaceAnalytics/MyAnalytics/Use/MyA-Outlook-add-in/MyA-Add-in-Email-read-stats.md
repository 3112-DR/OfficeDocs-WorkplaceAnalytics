## Email read statistics 

MyAnalytics can tell you how many people have opened your emails and how long they spent reading them. In general, it informs you about emails that you sent to five or more Office 365 users who are internal to your company (but see [Exceptions](#exceptions)). It displays this information in "cards," such as this one:

### Exceptions
MyAnalytics does not display this information about every email that you send. Specifically, it does not report about email messages in the following categories: 
 * email that was sent from a shared mailbox
 * email that was sent to a mailbox that was configured for email forwarding. The recipients of the forwarded email are not included in the qualifying recipient count.
 * email message in which the individual recipient count on each of the the To: and Cc: lines is less than 5 AND the Bcc: individual recipient count is also less than 5.

> [!Note] 
> When you send email that has recipients on the Bcc: line, the precision of the email-read statistics is lowered.  

After you send an email message, it takes up to fifteen minutes before MyAnalytics can inform you about it. MyAnalytics groups similar information into a single summary card that you can select and expand to see a more detailed view.
