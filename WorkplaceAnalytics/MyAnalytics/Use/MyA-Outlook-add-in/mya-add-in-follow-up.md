## Follow up on your tasks

MyAnalytics can help you follow up on requests you asked of others in email. MyAnalytics will automatically find tasks you requested of others based on your sent mails.  For example:

* “Can you send me this year’s latest report?”
* “Everyone, please complete your performance evaluations by the end of the week.”
* “Cancel my RSVP for Carrin Patman's lunch scheduled early next week.”

For one or more of these types of requests in your sent email in the last 14 days, you’ll see a follow-up summary card in your Outlook Insights panel.

**To see your follow-up card**

1. On the Outlook **Home** ribbon, select the **Insights** icon.
2. In the **Insights** panel, you’ll see the **Follow up on your requests** card.

3. Select the card to see more details and to do one or more of the following:

   * Select the email subject line from which the task was extracted to open that specific email.
   * Select **Follow up** to open the latest instance of the email.
   * Select **Mark as done** if the task is complete. Follow-ups disappear after two weeks or after you mark them as done.
   * If this task isn’t a follow-up, select the **ellipsis** (**…**) at bottom right, and then select This isn’t’ a follow up.
