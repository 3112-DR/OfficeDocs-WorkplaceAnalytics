# MyAnalytics wellbeing

The Wellbeing page shows how well you are disconnecting from work during your time off and suggests ways to reduce stress and burnout.

* **Quiet days** are the number of days where you spent less than two hours actively collaborating outside your set work schedule (as defined by your Outlook calendar). Active collaboration includes meetings, or multiple emails, chats, or calls that occurred during this time.

   For example: If your set work schedule is 8 AM to 5 PM, Monday through Friday, and you spent more than an hour reading or replying to email after 5 PM on Monday, and attended a meeting from 6 to 7 PM that same day, that Monday won't count as a quiet day.
