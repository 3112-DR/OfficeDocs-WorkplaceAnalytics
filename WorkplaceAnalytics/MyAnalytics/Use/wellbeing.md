# Wellbeing

The MyAnalytics Wellbeing page shows how well you are disconnecting from work during your time off and suggests ways to reduce stress and burnout.

## Productivity insights

These are based on your recent workplace activity. Select **View Suggestions** to get ideas on how you might change your current work patterns to improve your work-life balance.

## About the metrics

* **Quiet days** are the number of days where you spent less than two hours actively collaborating outside your set work schedule (as defined by your Outlook calendar). Active collaboration includes meetings, or multiple emails, chats, or calls that occurred during this time.

   For example: If your set work schedule is 8 AM to 5 PM, Monday through Friday, and you spent more than an hour reading or replying to email after 5 PM on Monday, and attended a meeting from 6 to 7 PM that same day, that Monday won't count as a quiet day.

## Wellbeing tips

#### Turn work off when not at work

We all need breaks to recharge. Turning work "off" outside of working hours can help you get a better night's sleep and show up feeling refreshed the next day.

#### Turn off notifications when not at work

 Some find it helpful to reserve one night a week away from work or mute notifications outside of working hours. Research shows that people who disconnect daily from work report lower levels of stress and higher wellbeing.

#### Take a break when at work

Go enjoy a meal with your team or take a relaxation break during work. You’ll give your brain a break, grow your network, and probably boost your productivity and professional success.

#### Be a thoughtful coworker!

Establishing quiet hours with no meetings or email can lead to better teamwork:

* For "inform" type emails, condense the emails and status updates into daily or weekly digests. This reduces the overall noise and randomization caused by email overload.
* Save drafts or delay delivery for email until the recipients’ normal business hours. Limit late night and early morning email to urgent email, to cut through the noise.
* Turn off notifications on your phone and desktop when you are trying to focus.

As a team, be respectful of people’s time. For example:  

* Agree on “team hours.”  
* Be intentional about who you invite to meetings.
* Try to limit meeting overruns.
* Consider starting a policy of no-meetings Wednesdays.
