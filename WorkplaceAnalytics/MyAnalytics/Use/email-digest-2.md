# MyAnalytics email digest

_**Applies to: Office 365 Enterprise E5, Office 365 A5, Office 365 Nonprofit E5, and MyAnalytics add-on**_

As a MyAnalytics user, you'll receive a weekly email digest with suggestions to help you better understand your work patterns and ways to improve them.

Each week will focus one of the following work patterns:

* **Focus** - Find ways to increase your focus hours, so you can accomplish deep work and unleash your creativity.
* **Wellbeing** - See if you’re getting good balance between work and personal time, then find ways to disconnect and unwind after hours.
* **Network** - See who’s in your network and make sure you’re keeping up with important contacts and relationships.
* **Collaboration** - Get tips on how to plan your calendar, spend less time in low-quality meetings, and write more effective emails.

The following is an example of an email digest about past work history.
