# MyAnalytics email digest

_**Applies to: Office 365 Enterprise E5, Office 365 A5, Office 365 Nonprofit E5, and MyAnalytics add-on**_

As a MyAnalytics user, you'll receive a weekly email digest with suggestions to help you meet your goals and improve your work habits. Each week will focus on a different goal or work habit:

* **Focus** - Ways to increase your focus hours, so you can accomplish deep work and unleash your creativity.
* **Balance and wellbeing** - Ways to balance your time between your working hours and life outside of work.
* **Relationships** - Ways to keep up and collaborate with important people and to continue to maintain or grow your network of people.
* **Better meetings** - Ways to help you plan your calendar, improve time efficiency, and improve meeting quality.

The following is an example of an email digest about past work history and an insight to help increase focus time.
