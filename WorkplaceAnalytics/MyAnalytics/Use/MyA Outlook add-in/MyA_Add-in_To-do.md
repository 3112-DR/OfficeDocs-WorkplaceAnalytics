# To do card

MyAnalytics can remind you to do tasks that are called out in email messages. In an automatic process, MyAnalytics finds instances in which a task is promised or requested, such as the following:  

* An email you sent generates a To-do card for you if it contains a statement such as “I will send you the plans.” 
* An email you received generates a To-do card for you if it contains a statement such as “Please review the highlighted items.”  

If you have one or more of these automatically generated tasks, a summary card is displayed in the MyAnalytics pane:

**To get more details**

You can obtain more details about your to-do items.  
1. In the MyAnalytics pane, click the summary card. This displays an individual card for each task. Each card shows the name of the email recipient, the subject line of the message that triggered the card, and the sentence in the message that promises something.

2. To open the message, click the message subject line. In this example, that line starts “RE: Updated invitation.” The email thread opens to the message that contains the triggering statement.  

To mark a to-do item as done, click **Mark as done**. To-do cards disappear after two weeks or after you mark them as done.
