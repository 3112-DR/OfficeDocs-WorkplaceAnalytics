# Collaboration

Collaboration in MyAnalytics shows who you're working with most and how well you're maintaining your relationships at work.

A dedicated page for Collaboration is coming soon to MyAnalytics.

## Productivity insights

These are based on your recent collaboration activity at work. Select **View Suggestions** to get ideas on how you might change or improve your current collaboration work pattern.

## Collaboration tips

You might miss out on valuable collaboration time if you're spending too much time on email or impromptu calls or in meetings or chats. Research shows that typically doing just four to five things differently can enable you to increase your collaboration time by 18% to 24%.

#### Batch email time

To reduce distraction, try checking your inbox once an hour. If that works well, try checking email every two hours and so on. Discover how much time you can get back.

#### Group your meetings together on your calendar

If your calendar is fragmented with meetings, try grouping your meetings on your calendar, so you have longer free blocks available for team collaboration.

#### Reduce the meetings you attend and schedule

Fewer meetings can open up more time for collaboration. Review your recurring meetings to make sure they're a good use of time each week. 

Check the attendee lists for meetings you organize. Try condensing meetings with identical attendees.

In an office culture where meetings fill the day, make the most of yours. By setting expectations and making goals clear ahead of time, meetings can become more efficient. Giving you and your colleagues some time back.

#### Respond to meetings on time

Make sure to respond to meeting invites on time so that your team knows what to expect. Coworkers can better prepare for meetings when they have a good sense of who plans to attend.

#### Give people time to prepare for meetings

Last-minute invitations are sometimes necessary, but your meetings may be more effective if you give attendees sufficient time to prepare.

#### Include meeting agendas and action items in your invites

Add agendas and action items to get the most out of your meetings. Consider adding clarity for what you’d like participants to do with attached files in your meeting invitations.

#### Start and end meetings on time

When meetings start on time, they are more likely to finish on time and meet the objectives of the meeting. Consider blocking time for preparation before the start of the meetings to avoid late starts. 

Better meeting practices can improve productivity, information sharing, innovation, decision-making, and team collaboration.

#### Cancel meetings a day ahead

If possible, send cancellations to attendees the day before. Do your best to plan ahead so that attendees can optimally repurpose that time.

#### Take long email threads offline

For long email threads that increase over the course of a few weeks, consider taking the email offline and scheduling a meeting to synch up.
