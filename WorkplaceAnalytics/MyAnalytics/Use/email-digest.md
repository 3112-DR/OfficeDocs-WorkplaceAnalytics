# MyAnalytics email digest

As a MyAnalytics user, you will receive a weekly email digest that gives you key highlights about your previous week. This email digest contains links that you can click to open your MyAnalytics dashboard. 

The following illustration shows some of the contents of this email:

2. Go to Feature Setting and select **Off** for Digest Email.
3. Click **OK** to save the changes.

[!Note] Skype for Business data might be delayed by up to four days. So a user action completed on a Friday might not be included in MyAnalytics computations that are done on a Monday. After the data comes in, the metrics are updated. For example,. in some cases a Digest email sent on a Monday or Tuesday will not include the data if it is delayed.
