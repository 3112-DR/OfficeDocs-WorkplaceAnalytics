# MyAnalytics email digest

_**Applies to: Office 365 Enterprise E5, Office 365 A5, Office 365 Nonprofit E5, and MyAnalytics add-on**_

As a MyAnalytics user, you will receive a weekly email digest that'll provide suggestions to help you meet your goals and improve your work habits. Each week will focus on a different goal or work habit, such as:

* **Focus** - Ways to increase your focus hours, so you can accomplish deep work and unleash your creativity.
* **Balance and wellbeing** - Ways to balance your time between your working hours and life outside of work.
* **Relationships** - Ways to keep up and collaborate with important people and to continue to maintain or grow your network of people.
* **Better meetings** - Ways to help you plan your calendar, improve time efficiency, and improve meeting quality.

The following is an example of an email digest.
