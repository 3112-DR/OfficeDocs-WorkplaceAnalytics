# MyAnalytics dashboard 2019

_**Applies to: Office 365 Enterprise E5, Office 365 A5, Office 365 Nonprofit E5, and MyAnalytics add-on**_

Thank you for trying the new MyAnalytics experience. Your new personal, goal-oriented dashboard aims to help you understand how you spend your time and collaborate with colleagues.

MyAnalytics gives you valuable new insights about how to increase focus, achieve work life balance, and improve your work relationships and team collaboration.

**To open your personal MyAnalytics dashboard**: Go to [myanalytics.microsoft.com](https://myanalytics.microsoft.com)

## Your work habits

The Home page includes helpful statistics about your work activities over the past month, including your focus and collaboration time, how many days you were able to disconnect from work, and how effectively you are networking with other people at work.

See [MyAnalytics Tips](../Overview/tips.md) for suggestions on how to plan your calendar to improve your focus time, run more efficient meetings, and get better work-life balance.

## Focus and Wellbeing

This section of the Explore page gives you ways to plan time for specific tasks, such as booking focus time in your calendar and adding tasks to the body of the appointment.

It also shows how well you are disconnecting from work during your time off and suggests ways to balance work with life.

## Your Network

This section shows the people you actively networked with and your total network size based on work activities, such as email, chats, calls, and meetings.

It also shows your top collaborators in either a map or list view, enables you to view details about the important people in your network, and suggests people to add to your important list of people.
