### About the metrics

* **Collaboration** is based on meetings, emails, chats, and calls with Teams and Skype for Business.

* **Available to focus** is based on blocks of 2+ hours of free time in your calendar. Both are calculated only for your working hours, as determined by your Outlook calendar.

   For example: If you spent 20 hours in meetings, emails, and chats in a given week, and had 10 hoursâ€™ worth of focus blocks (2+ contiguous hours of free time on your calendar) in your calendar that week, then your dashboard will show 67% collaboration and 33% available focus time for that week.
