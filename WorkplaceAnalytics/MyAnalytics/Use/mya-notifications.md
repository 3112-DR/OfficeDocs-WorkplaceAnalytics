# Inline suggestions in Outlook

**_Applies to: Office 365 Enterprise E5, Office 365 A5, Office 365 Nonprofit E5, and MyAnalytics add-on_**

## What are inline suggestions in Outlook?

Inline suggestions in Outlook are brief data and AI-driven notifications that appear in Outlook while you are either reading or composing an email or a meeting invitation.  

Inline suggestions can help boost your productivity and that of your team by displaying useful suggestions, tips, and best practices around managing email and running meetings. They help inform and guide you in making effective email and meeting decisions. They can also help you reclaim focus hours and build better collaboration habits, in addition to other practical benefits. [Types of inline suggestions](#types-of-inline-suggestions) lists some of the inline suggestions you might see in Outlook.

## How inline suggestions work

Insights can display inline suggestions in the following ways.

1. While composing a meeting invitation or an email.

   In this example, the nudge is shown at the top of an email, reminding you of the after-hours impact you’ll generate for your colleagues. The nudge suggests that you clarify the email's urgency, so that recipients know if it can wait until working hours. Alternatively, you can hide the nudge temporarily by selecting **Dismiss this message**.

2. While reading an email or a calendar invitation.

3. While reading an email, this nudge reminds you of a potential outstanding task item for the email sender. Selecting the link takes you to the Insights Outlook add-in, which shows the list of task items.

## Why don’t I see any inline suggestions?

Inline suggestions are available in the latest versions of Outlook for the web and Outlook for Windows with Microsoft 365 or Office 365 licenses. In Outlook for Windows, inline suggestions will show up while reading or composing email and while you have a meeting invitation open. In Outlook for the web, only inline suggestions while reading email and meetings are available at this time. These suggestions are not currently available in Outlook for Mac, Outlook for iOS, or Outlook for Android.

## Providing feedback

You can provide feedback for each nudge by using the feedback control at the bottom of the Insights Outlook panel. If you send a thumbs down, we’ll show you less of that suggestion.

You can always provide overall feedback by selecting the smiley face in the upper-right corner of the Insights Add-in panel.

## To opt out of inline suggestions

1. To opt out of inline suggestions in Outlook, select the **Insights** icon on the Outlook Home ribbon.

      If you are using Outlook on the web, the **Insights** icon is in the top right corner of the reading pane, or in the bottom right corner of the compose form.
