# MyAnalytics nudges in Outlook

## What are MyAnalytics nudges in Outlook? 
MyAnalytics nudges in Outlook (or MyAnalytics nudges) are brief, data and AI-driven notifications that appear in Microsoft Outlook while you are either reading or composing an email or a meeting invitation.  

MyAnalytics nudges can help boost your productivity and that of your team by displaying useful suggestions, tips, and best practices around managing email and running meetings. They help inform and guide you in making effective email and meeting decisions. They can also help you to reclaim focus hours and build better collaboration habits, in addition to other practical benefits. See the
[MyAnalytics nudges](#MyAnalytics-nudges) table.

## How MyAnalytics nudges work 
MyAnalytics nudges are seamlessly integrated into Outlook for Windows and Outlook on the web. MyAnalytics can display nudges in two ways: 

1.  While composing a meeting invitation or an email:

 ![Nudges meeting image 01](../../Images/nudges-meeting-01.png)

 In this example, the nudge is shown at the top of an email, reminding you of the after-hours impact you’ve generated for your colleagues. The nudge suggests that you make clear just how urgent this email is, so that recipients know if it can wait until working hours. Alternatively, you can hide the nudge temporarily by selecting **Dismiss this message**. 

2. While reading an email or a calendar invitation: 

   ![Nudges email image 02](../../Images/nudges-email-02.png)

While reading an email, this nudge reminds you of a potential outstanding to-do for the email sender. Selecting the link takes you to the MyAnalytics Add-in, which shows the list of to-do items.

You can always provide overall feedback by selecting the smiley face in the upper right hand corner of the MyAnalytics Add-in. 

## Opting out of nudges
