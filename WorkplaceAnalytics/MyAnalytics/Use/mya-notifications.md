# MyAnalytics nudges in Outlook

_Applies to: Office 365 Enterprise E5, Office 365 A5, Office 365 Nonprofit E5, and MyAnalytics add-on_

## What are MyAnalytics nudges in Outlook? 
MyAnalytics nudges in Outlook (or MyAnalytics nudges) are brief, data and AI-driven notifications that appear in Microsoft Outlook while you are either reading or composing an email or a meeting invitation.  

MyAnalytics nudges can help boost your productivity and that of your team by displaying useful suggestions, tips, and best practices around managing email and running meetings. They help inform and guide you in making effective email and meeting decisions. They can also help you to reclaim focus hours and build better collaboration habits, in addition to other practical benefits. See the
[MyAnalytics nudges](#myanalytics-nudges) table.

## How MyAnalytics nudges work 
MyAnalytics can display nudges in two ways: 

1.  While composing a meeting invitation or an email.

 In this example, the nudge is shown at the top of an email, reminding you of the after-hours impact you’ve generated for your colleagues. The nudge suggests that you clarify the email's urgency, so that recipients know if it can wait until working hours. Alternatively, you can hide the nudge temporarily by selecting **Dismiss this message**. 

2. While reading an email or a calendar invitation.

While reading an email, this nudge reminds you of a potential outstanding to-do item for the email sender. Selecting the link takes you to the MyAnalytics Add-in, which shows the list of to-do items.

## Why don’t I see any MyAnalytics nudges? 
MyAnalytics nudges are available in the latest versions of Outlook for the web and Outlook for Windows with Office 365 licenses. In Outlook for Windows, nudges will show up while reading or composing email and while you have a meeting invitation open. In Outlook for the web, only nudges while reading email and meetings are available at this time. Nudges are not currently available in Outlook for Mac, Outlook for iOS, or Outlook for Android. 

## Providing feedback 
You can provide feedback for each nudge by using the feedback control at the bottom of the MyAnalytics Add-in screen. If you send a thumbs down, we’ll show you less of that nudge.

You can always provide overall feedback by selecting the smiley face in the upper-right corner of the MyAnalytics Add-in. 

## Opting out of nudges

1. To opt out of MyAnalytics nudges, navigate to the MyAnalytics Add-in by selecting the MyAnalytics button on the ribbon.  

      ![Nudges email image 05](../../Images/mya/use/nudges-mya-tab-05.png)

      If you are using Outlook on the web, the MyAnalytics icon can be found in the top right corner of the reading pane, or in the bottom right corner of the compose form.
