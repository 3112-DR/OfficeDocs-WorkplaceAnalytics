## Focus hours

### How we calculate focus hours

Focus hours consist of at least two consecutive hours in your calendar without a meeting. Focus time consists of any combination of the following, as long as the time is consecutive and adds up to two hours or more:

* Unscheduled time
* Appointments
* Meetings that are scheduled only with yourself

The following time does not count toward your focus time:

* Time outside your set work hours
* Time marked as Out-of-Office

The MyAnalytics Dashboard displays a total of your weekly focus hours and meeting hours broken up by day. You can see how these compare to your personal goals. Use the information to help you know which days are typically your busiest so that you can plan your focus time accordingly.

See [Tips for focus time](../../Overview/Tips.md#tips-for-focus-time).
