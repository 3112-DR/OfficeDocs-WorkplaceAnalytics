# Your time
 
Near the top of the MyAnalytics dashboard is the “Your time” area. This area shows a concise overview of how you've spent your time this week and how this behavior compares with your goals.

## The stats that you see
This report shows summaries of the four main ways that MyAnalytics categorizes your time. For each category, you'll find more details further down on the page. 

For each category, MyAnalytics compares your actual number of hours with a time goal. You can change these weekly time goals. 

[!INCLUDE [Change your weekly goals](../../Includes/to-change-your-weekly-goals.md)]

See [MyAnalytics Tips](../../Overview/Tips.md) for suggestions on how you can spend your time more efficiently. 

### Network section
In the Network section of the MyAnalytics Dashboard you see the Your time investments chart. This chart provides you with an overview of your recent collaboration with individuals and groups in your network. For more information, see [Network](MyA-DB-Network.md).

## Other sections

For more information about each of the categories of hours, see the following sections: [Meeting hours](MyA-DB-Meetings.md), [Email hours](MyA-DB-Emails.md), [Focus hours](MyA-DB-Focus-hours.md), [After hours](MyA-DB-After-hours.md).
