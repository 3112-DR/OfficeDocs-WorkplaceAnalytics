## Can I opt out of MyAnalytics? 

You can opt out of MyAnalytics. Although, if you do, your data won't be used to calculate aggregate statistics for your organization. For example, if you opt out, your data will not be used to calculate statistics on the average time people in your organization spend in meetings, chats, and calls, and on email.
