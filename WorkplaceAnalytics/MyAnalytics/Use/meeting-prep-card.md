### To view and use the meeting preparation card

2.	On the **Insights** panel, locate the **Prepare for your meetings** card:

    This card provides information about meetings that you have organized for this week and next week (up to 10 business days in the future) and it helps you evaluate the state of those meetings. 

3.	Select the **Prepare for your meetings** card. This opens a panel that displays insights cards for each of your upcoming meetings:

These insights cards inform you of the following:

| Agenda       | **Yes** or **No** indicates whether the meeting invitation includes an agenda. |
| Attachments  | This section shows how many attachments the invitation has, it displays their titles and their storage location (online or locally), and it lets you click to see more details. It also provides a link that you can select to open the attachment, if the attachment is stored online. |  
| Online meeting link | **Yes** or **No** indicates whether the meeting invitation includes a link for joining the meeting online. | 
| Preparation time | This section provides options to book either 15 minutes or 30 minutes of preparation time right before the meeting. This option only appears if there is an available slot. Booked time appears on your calendar and references the meeting, as “Preparation time for [meeting title].” You can also cancel the meeting-preparation time or delete it directly from your calendar.

## Recommendations

The Meeting preparation card can help increase the quality of your meetings in the following ways: 

1. **Ensure that you have a quorum** before the meeting. Consider sending a reminder to attendees if you haven’t heard from them. 

2. **Agendas** often make a meeting run smoother. If your meeting requires an agenda, select **Agenda** in the card. This opens the meeting invitation, where you can add an agenda. 

3. **Be an inclusive meeting organizer**. If you have attendees who are working remotely, consider adding an online link to your meeting. To do this, select **Online meeting link** to add one. 

4. **Be prepared**. If you need travel time or have other tasks that need to be done immediately before the meeting to prepare for it, consider booking preparation time.
