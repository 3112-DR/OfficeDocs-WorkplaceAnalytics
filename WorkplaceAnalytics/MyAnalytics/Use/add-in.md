# Test links, first images and then text files

This one works (HTML): 

<img src="../../Images/Add_top_collaborator_ed.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="Add top collaborator card">

This one works (md relative path): 

![test image](../../Images/Add_top_collaborator_ed.png)

This one works: 

![test image](../../Images/Slider_off.png)

This one works -- in same folder:  

![test image](../Use/Slider_off.png)

Link that works:
[Test](Test_text.md)

This link also works (original casing):
[Test](../Use/Test_text.md)

This link also works (all lower case):
[Test](../Use/test_text.md)

### Same path usage

**None of these work:**

original casing

[!INCLUDE [Test](../Use/Test_text.md)]

all lower case

[!INCLUDE [Test](../Use/test_text.md)]

original casing, with tilde

[!INCLUDE [Test](~../Use/Test_text.md)]

all lower case, with tilde

[!INCLUDE [Test](~../Use/test_text.md)]

original casing, with tilde and slash

[!INCLUDE [Test](~/../Use/Test_text.md)]

all lower case, with tilde and slash

[!INCLUDE [Test](~/../Use/test_text.md)]
