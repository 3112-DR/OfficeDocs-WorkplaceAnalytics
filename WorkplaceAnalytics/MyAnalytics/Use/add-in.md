Did you ever miss an important email or forget a commitment you made to your co-workers? Do meetings and emails tend to take over your calendar? Do you ever wish to see reminders for 1:1 meetings with your manager, direct reports, or other top collaborators? Would you like to be notified if an upcoming meeting doesn't have a quorum?

If your answer to any of these questions is _yes_, the Outlook add-in provides actionable insights to help you stay on top of your tasks and get more done.

This add-in is an extension of your Outlook experience and works within Outlook to help you gain focus time, maintain your work relationships, and improve your overall work-life balance.
