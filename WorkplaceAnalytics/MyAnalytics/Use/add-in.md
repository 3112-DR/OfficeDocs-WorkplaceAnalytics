# MyAnalytics Outlook add-in

MyAnalytics helps you understand how you collaborate with colleagues and spend your time at work. The MyAnalytics Outlook add-in appears as a pane in Outlook. It presents you with information about your recent collaboration and communcation patterns and it suggests ways that you can work more effectively.

> [!Note] 
> To learn about the benefits of using MyAnalytics, see [Better work habits](../Overview/Better-work-habits.md).

## Informative cards in MyAnalytics

MyAnalytics draws email and meeting data from Outlook, notices patterns, and then the MyAnalytics Outlook add-in displays information in cards. Each card reports on an aspect of your behavior and suggests an action you can take. The following sections describe the cards that the add-in uses to communicate with you:  

[!INCLUDE [Add top collaborators](MyA-Outlook-add-in/MyA-Add-in-Add-top-collab.md)]

[!INCLUDE [To do](MyA-Outlook-add-in/MyA-Add-in-To-do.md)]
