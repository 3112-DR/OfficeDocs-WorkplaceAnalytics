Did you ever miss an important email or forget a commitment you made to your co-workers? Do meetings and emails tend to take over your calendar? Do you ever wish to see reminders for 1:1 meetings with your manager, direct reports, or other top collaborators? Would you like to be notified if an upcoming meeting doesn't have a quorum?

If your answer to any of these questions is _yes_, the Outlook add-in provides actionable insights to help you stay on top of your tasks and get more done.

## What you might see

In Outlook, open the add-in by selecting the **Insights** (swirl) icon in the Outlook Home ribbon. If you are using the Outlook Web App, first open an email message, and then select the **Insights** icon in the top-right corner of your email message.

You'll see insight cards in the right panel of your email window:
