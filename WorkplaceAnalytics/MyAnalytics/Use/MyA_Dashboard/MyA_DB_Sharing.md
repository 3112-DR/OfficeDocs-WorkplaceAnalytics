## Sharing your statistics 

Whether to celebrate achieving a goal, show progress to your manager, or ask for help, you can share selected statistics from your dashboard with people in your organization. By sharing statistics, you create more opportunities to receive support in the areas that matter most to you. So, share your statistics and get the conversation started.

### Where do I find the statistics that I’ve shared? 

Each time you share statistics, the email message in which you’ve shared them appears in your Outlook Sent Items folder. The people who receive your shared statistics receive this same message; it contains a link to their MyAnalytics dashboard, which displays the statistics that you shared with them. 

### Why can't I view shared statistics? 

Sometimes, shared statistics cannot be viewed. Here are common causes for this:  

* All shared statistics expire after 30 days. Once the expiration passes, the link to the shared statistics becomes inactive. 
* The email containing the shared statistics link was forwarded to a recipient rather than shared directly through the MyAnalytics dashboard.
