# Meeting hours

## How we calculate Meeting hours 
Meeting hours consist of any meetings that you’ve organized or accepted that have at least one other person attending.  

Meeting hours do not include any time outside your working hours, as you’ve defined working hours in your [Outlook settings](https://outlook.office.com/owa/?path=/options/calendarappearance). After-hours meeting time shows up in your after-hours stats.  

The following meeting types are also excluded from Meeting hours: 
* Meetings with no other participants than yourself, for example when you block time in your calendar or set reminders. 
* All-day meetings. 
* Meetings that are marked as Private. 

# Meeting habits  

## How we categorize meetings

The Meeting habits section categorizes the meetings you’ve accepted and shows how much time you spent in each type of meeting. Meetings are categorized as follows: 

* **Conflicting meetings:** Meetings that overlap with other meetings that you've accepted, and where your status is set to Busy.
* **Longer meetings:** Meetings that last longer than an hour. 
* **Recurring meetings:** Meetings that are part of a series or have recurrence. 
* **After hours meetings:** Meetings that occur outside your working hours, as you’ve defined working hours in your [Outlook settings](https://outlook.office.com/owa/?path=/options/calendarappearance).   
* **Multitasking in meetings:** Meetings in which you've sent more than two emails or read more than four emails per hour.
