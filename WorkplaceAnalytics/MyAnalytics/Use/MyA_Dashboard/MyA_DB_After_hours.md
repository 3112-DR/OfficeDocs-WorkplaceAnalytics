# After hours 

## How we calculate after hours
After-hours time consists of any accepted meeting time or email activity that you have done outside your work hours, as defined by your [Outlook settings](https://outlook.office.com/owa/?path=/options/calendarappearance). (For example, the time you spend reading or sending email messages on weekends counts as After-hours time.) 

[!INCLUDE [Check your Outlook settings](../../Includes/to_check_your_outlook_settings.md)]

**Note:** After hours is an estimate only and is not meant to reflect actual hours worked. You can compare how we calculate the times for [Meetings](MyA_DB_Meetings.md) and for [Email](MyA_DB_Emails.md). 

See [After hours tips](../../Overview/Tips.md#tips-for-after-hours) for suggestions related to work-life balance.
