# After hours 

## How we calculate after hours
After-hours time consists of any accepted meeting time or email activity that you have done outside your work hours, as defined by your [Outlook settings](https://outlook.office.com/owa/?path=/options/calendarappearance). (For example, the time you spend reading or sendi ng email messages on weekends is After-hours time.) 

**Check your Outlook settings**

You can update your settings in Outlook to change what time is counted as after-hours work:
1.	In Microsoft Outlook, click the File tab and click Options. 
2.	In the Outlook Options dialog box, click Calendar.
3.	In the Work time area, adjust the settings for Start time and End time and your selections for days of the Work week. 

**Note:** After hours is an estimate only and is not meant to reflect actual hours worked. You can compare how we calculate the times for [Meetings](MyA_DB_Meetings.md) and for [Email](MyA_DB_Emails.md). 

See [After hours tips](../../Overview/Tips.md#tips-for-after-hours) for suggestions related to work-life balance.
