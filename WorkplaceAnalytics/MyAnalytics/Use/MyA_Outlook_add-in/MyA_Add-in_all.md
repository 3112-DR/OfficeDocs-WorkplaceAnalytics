# MyAnalytics Outlook add-in

MyAnalytics helps you understand how you collaborate with colleagues and spend your time at work. The MyAnalytics Outlook add-in appears as a pane in Outlook. It presents you with information about your recent collaboration and communcation patterns and it suggests ways that you can work more effectively. 

MyAnalytics draws email and meeting data from Outlook, notices patterns, and then the MyAnalytics Outlook add-in displays information in cards. Each card reports on an aspect of your behavior and suggests an action you can take. The following sections describe the cards that the add-in uses to communicate with you:  

[!INCLUDE [Add top collaborators](MyA_Add-in_top_collab.md)]

[!INCLUDE [To do](MyA_Add-in_To-do.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Unread emails](MyA_Add-in_Unread_emails.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Email read statistics](MyA_Add-in_Email_read_statistics.md)]
