# Diagnose problems

Your collaboration problem might already be clear to you or you might be like many of us who feel overwhelmed by collaborative demands but donâ€™t know just where to begin. We can help you diagnose your problems. 

First, ask yourself the following questions grouped by collaboration category:

### Meetings

 * In general, are the meetings I attend an effective use of my time?
 * Could I improve the way I organize and lead meetings?
 * Are meetings preventing me from focusing on getting my most important work done?
 * Am I fully present and able to add value in the meetings that I attend?
 * Am I spending time with the people who are most critical to my priorities?

### Emails

 * Is the volume of emails I receive appropriate, given my role?
 * Am I able to effectively manage my inbox?
 * Could I improve the way I compose my emails?
 * Do I rely too heavily on email versus other communication methods?
 * Am I constantly checking email throughout the day?

### Focus hours

 * Am I able to schedule sufficient time to focus on getting my most important work done?
 * Do I regularly come up with creative and original ideas?
 * Am I constantly getting interrupted by others and/or distracted by technology?
 * Do I regularly achieve my important deadlines?
 * Do I have adequate control over my schedule?

### After hours

 * Does my job interfere with my personal life?
 * Am I constantly reading and sending emails when I am home?
 * Do I choose after-hours meetings over personal commitments?
 * Am I able to get my most important work done during my regular business hours?
 * Do I feel drained and stressed at the end of the day?

After reflecting on those questions, does a single collaboration category stand out as your biggest pain point or are you suffering in more than one category? If more than one category, then we recommend that you prioritize and select one category to focus on to get started.

Next, look at your MyAnalytics dashboard to use data to validate your collaboration pain point and dig deeper to help uncover root causes. We recommend that you look at the past three weeks to help identify patterns and trends. Here are questions to ask to help you analyze the data:

## Meetings

<img src="../../Images/Adopt-indiv-1.PNG" alt="Dashboard Meetings area">
  
 * Is my total number of meetings hours per week as a percentage of my work week very high?
 * Are most of the meetings I attend scheduled by me or by others?
 * Which of the low-quality meeting habits appears to be my biggest problem?

## Email
 
<img src="../../Images/Adopt-indiv-2.PNG" alt="Dashboard Email area">
  
 * Is my total number of email hours per week as a percentage of my work week very high?
 * Am I spending more time writing emails than reading emails?
 * Am I emailing throughout the day or at specific times during the day?
 * Am I reading and sending a lot of emails outside business hours?

## Focus Hours
 
<img src="../../Images/Adopt-indiv-3.PNG" alt="Dashboard Focus hours area">
  
 * Is my total number of focus hours per week as a percentage of my work week sufficient?
 * Which days during the week do I typically get the most time to focus?
 * Is the amount of time I spend meeting with others versus focusing on my individual work appropriate for my job?

## After Hours
 
<img src="../../Images/Adopt-indiv-4.PNG" alt="Dashboard After Hours area">
  
 * Is my total after-hours number acceptable?
 * Am I collaborating after hours on certain days or every day?
 * Am I spending the majority of my after hours in meetings or on email?

## Network
 
<img src="../../Images/Adopt-indiv-5.PNG" alt="Dashboard Network area">
  
 * Do my time investments in people line up with my top priorities?
 * Are there opportunities for me to meet more with or less with certain individuals?
 * Is anyone missing from my map with whom I should be spending time?
 * Am I acting as a bottleneck for certain people because I am too slow to respond to their emails?

Now that you have analyzed your collaboration problem both qualitatively and quantitatively, you are well positioned to set specific goals. But before you set your goals, we recommend that you spend time thinking about why changing your behaviors is important. This helps to strengthen your motivation.
