# Measure

## Program debrief

At the end of your program, determine its results by collecting data from program participants in a post-program survey (see create surveys and data sharing for more information). If you identified an outcome metric to measure simultaneously, combine that data with the MyAnalytics and survey data. If you included a control group in your program, survey and collect any relevant data from your control group as well.

After youâ€™ve collected and analyzed data and feedback, schedule a program-debrief meeting with the program participants to share results, key takeaways, and a proposal for next steps. Next steps could include additional MyAnalytics change programs and should also include the support you intend to provide program participants to sustain behavior change (see [Reinforce](Team-adopt-reinforce.md)). We recommend that you schedule this meeting for at least an hour and make sure to allocate time for active group discussions.
