# Plan

## Build the program team

Who are the members of a MyAnalytics Habit Change program team and what are their roles and responsibilities?
The ideal team is comprised of the following members:

 * Executive Sponsor
 * Program Manager
 * Change Agents
 * Program Participants

> [!Note] 
> If you are a manager of a small team interested in running this program, focus on the program manager and program participants roles. However, we encourage you to at the very least inform your manager or an executive sponsor of your admirable effort to help your team build heathier collaboration habits. 

### Executive sponsor

The executive sponsor is an influential senior-level leader who understands and actively promotes the value of developing healthier collaboration habits. This person should be committed to endorsing the use of MyAnalytics and serving as a role model for healthy work habits. The program participants must be in this person’s organization.  

The critical responsibilities of the executive sponsor are:

 * Participate in defining and communicating the program purpose
 * Remove obstacles in the way of the team’s success1
 * Build excitement for MyAnalytics and the change program
 * Participate in select program activities
 * Serve as a role model for behaviors that you want to promote
 * Encourage managers to participate and support the change

### Program manager

The program manager is the main architect of the program and leads implementation. This person can either be the manager of the program participants or another influential and well-respected member of the team who is endorsed by the team’s manager. It is important that this person have strong project management skills. It is also helpful for this person to have previous experience building and running change programs for a group.

The critical responsibilities for the program manager are:

 * Secure support from an executive sponsor if the program is not driven from the top
 * Identify, train, and manage change agents
 * Remove obstacles in the way of the team’s success1
 * Lead program communications and regularly reinforce the program purpose
 * Structure the change program and lead activities
 * Facilitate discussions and idea sharing at check-ins and through collaboration channels
 * Champion the MyAnalytics product and act as an internal product expert
 * Collect, manage and analyze program feedback and data
 * Serve as a role model for behaviors that you want to promote

Managers typically focus on incentives to motivate people to change, but often we can do more to facilitate change by removing obstacles than by pushing people into a certain direction (Nudge, by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, Pgs. 71-72). For example, if your team’s goal is to add more focus hours but there are no places in your office for quiet work, then designate a few “no-interruption zones” in your space dedicated to focus time. 

### Change agents

Change agents are influential team members who help drive program awareness and engagement. They are typically natural people connectors who are great communicators, enthusiastic and forward thinking. In many cases, especially if the number of program participants is large, the change agentsshare responsibilities with the program manager. 

The critical responsibilities for the change agents are:

 * Amplify program communications
 * Build excitement for the program
 * Champion MyAnalytics and act as internal product experts
 * Lead select program activities, such as program check-ins
 * Prime discussions and idea sharing through collaboration channels
 * Collect and share program feedback with the program manager
 * Serve as a role model for behaviors that you want to promote

### Program participants

The program participants are the most critical members of the team. Without their active and willing participation, change is impossible. While there is no minimum team size, a team comprised of between 10 and 20 participants is ideal. If a team has more than 20 people, then we recommend thoughtfully breaking the population into subgroups based on common characteristics and assigning change agents to lead each subgroup. If you are looking to select a group from a large population, we recommend that you select a team that is central to your network and could inspire other teams to adopt healthier work habits.

The critical responsibilities for the program participants are:

 * Learn and actively use MyAnalytics
 * Attend group meetings – for example, check-ins
 * Participate in group discussions and share ideas
 * Complete all program surveys
 * Provide input to help set goals
 * Commit time to learning about habit change
 * Experiment with new habits
 * Provide feedback on the program
 * Help hold teammates accountable for change

If a program participant chooses to share personal data to be aggregated at the team level to track and measure goal attainment, they must also share data with the program manager according to given instructions.
In addition, you should let program participants opt-in or opt-out of the program. If someone wants to opt-out, spend time with that person to understand why and to address his or her concerns. It is best to identify these people early in the program to avoid resistance that could prevent success later in the program.

## Structure the program

How do I structure a program that works best for my team?
To structure a program that best meets the needs of your team, define the following:

 * Program duration and dates
 * Program components
 * An outcome metric (optional)
 * A control group (optional)

### Program duration and dates

We recommend a program duration of 12 weeks to give people adequate time to learn how to use MyAnalytics, process new learnings, and experiment with new habits. Depending on a team’s needs and where they are in the behavior-change journey, programs that are shorter or longer can be successful, too. 

When you select the program’s start and end dates, find a period in which you expect few major disruptions to your team’s calendar. For example, avoid the holiday season and the summer vacation period since data during those periods typically doesn’t reflect your team’s average work week. Also, consider your team’s rhythm of business; avoid running a program during periods in which you have a peak in your workload and collaboration activities, such as around big or unusual project deadlines.

If MyAnalytics is new for your team, we recommend that you start the program two weeks after the product is launched to give it time to generate adequate data to reveal its ull features and to give program participants enough data to establish meaningful baselines for tracking and measuring progress.

### Program components

The following are the recommended main program components:

 * Kickoff meeting
 * Surveys
 * Learning modules
 * Habit-change playbooks 
 * Check-ins
 * Collaboration channel

While including all these components can help you run a successful program, even more important is that you design a program that meets the needs of your team. To that end, we recommend that you read the sections about these components to learn more so that you can select the ones that will work best for your team. For example, if your group communicates well by using a collaboration application and you are aiming to minimize the weekly time commitment, you might choose to exclude weekly check-in meetings and rely solely on the application for program discussions. 

After you select the components that you want to include in your program, determine the right dates and frequency for each component. After you complete those steps, you can estimate a weekly time commitment for the team members to be included in your program launch communications. Also, consider when you want the executive sponsor to become visible and active during the program. Program-activity options for the executive sponsor include sending an encouraging email or participating in a check-in.

The following are examples of program structures and schedules:  
 
##A complementary outcome metric (optional)

We recommend that you define a complementary outcome metric to measure during the program in addition to the MyAnalytics metrics you will be tracking and measuring. Examples of complementary  outcome metrics include engagement and productivity scores that are appropriate for your team and measured outside of MyAnalytics. The outcome metric will help you better determine the outcomes of your MyAnalytics Habit Change Program. For example, “The team reclaimed four hours of focus time each week. This helped them feel less stress and/or receive higher customer satisfaction scores due to higher-quality work/product delivered.”

## Control group (optional)

We recommend that you establish a control group to help determine whether the habit changes that occurred during the program resulted from the program or from other changes in your business. A control group is a group of people who are related to your group but who do not participate in the program – for example, if your department has 50 people, then ask only half of the group to actively participate in program activities. To determine how data changes for the control group during the program, you can ask them to fill out the pre- and post-program surveys and/or to share data, if they use MyAnalytics. 

Comparing the control results with the program metrics can help you gain a clear understanding of the drivers for change, which in turn helps your efforts to sustain new behaviors after the program ends. 

# Develop a communications plan

## Communicate the program to the participants effectively

Frequent and open communication is a top contributor to a successful change program. We recommend that consistency and transparency be your overall guiding principles. Important topics to address are expectations, plans, and how the change will affect employees (Prosci Best Practices Report).

Specifically, when communicating with program participants, the general guidelines we recommend are:

 * Focus on the impact of the change on the employee.
 * Be clear about what you know now and what you do not know now.
 * Let employees know when more information will be available.
 * Be clear how employees can provide feedback about the program.

The following is a template to help you develop your communication plan for the program (the example shown in italics in the template):

| Program milestone	| Audience | Content | Delivery Mechanism | Communicator | Date |
| -----	| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Launch |Program participants | <li>Program introduction<li>MyAnalytics description<li>Program purpose to believe in and expected outcomes<li>High-level overview of program structure<li>Expectations<li>Next steps<li>Program contacts for questions and help | Email | Executive sponsor | January 1 |
| Milestone 2 |   |   |   |   |   |		

## Program-launch email

Frequent communication is a cornerstone of your plan. This includes a strong email to launch your program, which is essential for setting your program on the right course. Our top tips for it are:

 * Have the executive sponsor send it. 
 * Keep it as short as possible (rely on links to more detailed information when available).
 * Personalize the message to draw attention.
 * Frame the program as an opportunity for learning and experimentation.
 * Provide employees with program contact information and easy feedback channel.
 * Include the MyAnalytics Privacy Information.

We recommend the following template for your program launch email:

 * Program introduction
 * MyAnalytics product overview
 * Program purpose statement (see Conditions for Program Success)
 * High-level overview of program structure
   * Start and end dates
   * Main components
   * Program team
 * Immediate action items and next steps
   * Add link to the Pre-Program Survey
   * Any additional action items
   * Expected first program event, such as the kick-off meeting
 * Preferred method to provide feedback and ask questions throughout the program
 * Links to more information on MyAnalytics and privacy
   * MyAnalytics Overview
   * MyAnalytics Product Demo Video
   * MyAnalytics What's New Video
   * Customer Case Study
   * Privacy Information
   * Link to terms and definitions on doc site

## Gain support from other teams

Our work culture depends increasingly on multiteaming, in which people are assigned to multiple projects simultaneously and cross-functionally. Because of this, it is important that you inform other teams you work closely with about your team’s intentions to change its collaboration habits. Managing the expectations of other teams will enable your team to follow through on practicing the new habits they select. This is a key step in the process of removing barriers to change. The added benefit is that you might inspire other teams to embark on behavior change journeys as well.

## Establish a collaboration channel

Adding a social component to your program will help new habits spread. We recommend that you set up a collaboration channel – for example, a Microsoft Teams channel, to support your program. 

Humans are social animals and we are heavily influenced by what those around us say and do. Social norms, which are the values, actions, and expectations of your group, guide your team’s behaviors (EAST Behavioral Change Method). A collaboration channel enables the members of your team to showcase new habits, share experiences (wins and challenges), support one another, make commitments to change, ask product questions, and provide feedback on the program.

An additional benefit of the collaboration channel is that it serves as a great program-management tool. You can provide updates on the program and links to resources as well as store program materials on the channel to make them easy for program participants to find.

## Create surveys

In addition to the quantitative data that MyAnalytics provides, we recommend that you collect qualitative data using surveys before, during, and after your program. Surveys help you better diagnose collaboration pain points, identify solutions, and understand the results of your program. When creating a survey, aim to keep it as short as possible and avoid these common survey question mistakes: Where Employee Surveys on Burnout and Engagement Go Wrong. We recommend that you use a survey application such as Microsoft Forms to conduct your surveys. For more information on how to create an effective survey, see Run an Employee Survey.

The surveys that we recommend are:

### Pre-program survey

The pre-program survey helps you diagnose your team’s collaboration pain points. Perception is often different from reality and this survey helps you better understand your team’s actual needs. You use this understanding, in turn, to define your program goals and recommend new habits that strongly resonate with the group. We recommend that you include a link to your pre-program survey in the program-launch email.

Here are suggested pre-program-survey questions to use, tailor, and/or build on: Pre-Program Survey Questions

### Team norms survey

During your program, you will learn many new habits in the Learning Modules, some of which will work for your team and others that will not. After you explore a topic – for example, Meetings – and trying out different habits, we recommend that you conduct a team-norms survey to agree on new norms to adopt as a team. For additional information on how to select group norms and make them stick, see How to Create Executive Team Norms and Make Them Stick.

Here are suggested team-norms survey questions to use, tailor, and/or build on for meetings, emails and focus hours: Norms Survey Questions 

To avoid fatigue from a long survey,  We recommend that you bundle the team norms survey with a corresponding learning module at the appropriate time in your program schedule. The survey should be completed after the program participants have had time to process the contents of the learning module and experiment with suggested habits.

### Post-program survey

You use the post-program survey to collect additional information on the results of your program. It helps you determine whether your program was successful and what the next steps are in your journey to develop heathier work habits. It can also be the way that you manually collect MyAnalytics data from individuals to measure goal attainment. (See Data Sharing for an alternative way to collect team-level data).

Here are suggested post-program survey questions to use, tailor and/or build on: Post-Program Survey Questions

## Goal-setting survey

A survey can be used to help you set your team goals. To learn more about goal setting and using a survey to help you do so, see Goal setting.
