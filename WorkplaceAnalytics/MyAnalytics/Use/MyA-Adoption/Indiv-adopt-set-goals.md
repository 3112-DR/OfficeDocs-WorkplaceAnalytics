# Set goals

Once you have diagnosed your collaboration problem and clearly defined your “why” for change, you are ready to set your specific MyAnalytics goal.

You can set your goals in your MyAnalytics dashboard:

The dashboard displays the four main MyAnalytics metrics (Meeting hours, Email hours, Focus hours, and After hours), but you aren’t limited to these four metrics for setting goals. To help you set goals, use the following table, which contains both productivity outcomes and corresponding MyAnalytics metrics: 

| Productivity Outcome	| MyAnalytics Metric  |	Goal Example |
| ------	| -----  |	----- |
| Reduce the number of hours that I spend in ineffective meetings |	<li>Meeting hours <li>Number of hours in conflicting meetings<li>Number of hours in multitasking meetings<li>Number of hours in longer meetings<li>Number of hours in recurring meetings<li>Number of hours in after-hours meetings | Reduce hours in multitasking meetings by 50% |
| Schedule more focus hours to boost my productivity, creativity, and decision-making | <li>Focus hours<li>Focus-hours-to-meeting-hours ratio (use the focus habits chart in your dashboard) |	Spend an equal amount of time in meetings and focus sessions |
Manage my inbox more effectively | <li>Email hours<li>Number of emails sent and/or received during and outside of business hours<li>Hours writing emails<li>Hours sending emails | Send zero emails outside of business hours |
Improve the effectiveness of the emails I send | <li>Email hours<li>Number of emails sent and/or received during and outside of business hours<li>Hours writing emails<li>Hours sending emails | Reduce the number of emails sent by 25% |
Reduce my after-hours collaboration to achieve a better work-life balance | <li>After hours<li>Emails sent/received outside business hours<li>Hours in after-hours meetings	| Spend less than 1 hour per week collaborating outside of business hours | 
Spend more time with the people in my network who are aligned with my top priorities | “Your Time Investments” metrics:<li>Meeting time <li>Response rate<li>Read rate<li>1:1 meetings | Spend two more hours per week with select important contacts (that is, move a person from “right to left” in your “Your Time Investments” map in your dashboard) |
