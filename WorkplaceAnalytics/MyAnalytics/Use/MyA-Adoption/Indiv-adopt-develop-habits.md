# Develop new habits

There are numerous habits you could adopt to achieve a specific goal. For example, if your goal is to reduce your meeting hours by 50%, you could achieve that goal by, for example: 1) saying no to meetings that don’t include an agenda, 2) avoiding meetings during which you multitask and/or 3) dividing and conquering meetings you share with a coworker. 

There is no one-size-fits-all solution to collaboration problems. Our Learning Modules and Habit-Change Playbooks help you identify new habits to adopt, and change your habits based on behavioral science.

## Learning modules
A learning module is a collection of materials that are focused on a collaboration topic and are meant to help you develop new habits and better understand how to use MyAnalytics. Learning Modules include habit suggestions, habit-change playbooks, tips on how to interpret MyAnalytics data and use product features, links to articles to learn more about specific topics, productivity lessons, and fun behavioral-science lessons. 

Here are the four learning modules: Meetings, Emails, Focus Hours, and After Hours.

## Habit change playbooks
Habit change playbooks   let you experiment with developing new habits by using MyAnalytics data. These playbooks are examples of microlearning, a method of learning through bite-sized lessons that leverages science around behavior change and habit formation. 
Habit formation is compatible with microlearning since the key to building new habits is simplicity and starting small. BJ Fogg, PhD, a behavioral scientist at Stanford University who has studied behavior change for over two decades, said that “baby steps” are one of the only things what will change behavior in the long term.

Each habit-change challenge provides a suggested habit, an explanation of why the habit is important, and a goal-oriented plan to experiment with the habit. We recommend that you make your challenge into a competition to make it more fun – ask a coworker or your team to try to change the habit with you. You can find the complete collection of challenges in the following sections and in the learning modules.
