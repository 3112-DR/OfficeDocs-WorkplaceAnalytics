# Sustain change

Practicing new habits is one thing but making them stick is another. We get it and have some tips to help you:

## Reward yourself

Rewards are critical to habit formation. We all have heard about how animals such as rats, dogs and monkeys can learn new behaviors in labs when given rewards such as food. Human beings are no different from other animals when it comes to habit formation. 

In his book The Power of Habit, Charles Duhigg describes the habit-formation process as a three-step loop. “First there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is a routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future.”

To sustain your new behaviors, aka routines, and turn them into habits, make sure to continually reward yourself. Thankfully you don’t have to give yourself a cookie every time you, for example, decline a meeting to turn that routine into a habit. Lots of different types of rewards work. Using the same example, rewards could range from doing something as simple as raising your arms in victory every time you say no to a meeting to using some of the time you have reclaimed to have lunch on Friday with someone important in your network.

Just like we encourage you to experiment with habits to find the new routines that work best for you, experiment with rewards. Sometimes when you are struggling to make a new habit stick, it’s not because the habit was poorly chosen, but because you haven’t paired it with the right reward.

Finally, cravings have been shown to drive the habit-formation loop. To spark a craving, allow yourself to anticipate the reward. Before or during your new behavior, think about the reward that you will experience. For example, picture yourself enjoying great food and conversation with a favorite colleague while you decline that meeting.

## Manage expectations

It is difficult to follow through on changing your habits when you lack the support of your team. Inform your manager and the people with whom you work the most of the new habits you are trying to develop. This communication will enable you to manage their expectations. For example, if a new habit you’re working on is to stop sending emails at night, let your coworkers know that they’ll have to wait till morning to hear from you and if there is an emergency, they must call you.

Creating boundaries around how you collaborate can feel uncomfortable. We operate under many assumptions that suggest we can’t do it. However, people typically respond positively to your boundaries and quickly adapt to new ways of working when it becomes evident that your performance isn’t suffering as a result. The added benefit of communicating boundaries and managing expectations is that you can inspire others to change as well.

## Work as a team

Even better than managing your team’s expectations to sustain your behavior change is to get your team to change habits with you. Human behaviors are heavily influenced by social norms, which are the values, actions and expectations of a group. If you and a few others start demonstrating a certain habit, others are likely to adopt the new behavior and it will spread across your entire team.

Professor Sandy Pentland, who directs the MIT Connection Science and Human Dynamics labs, has said that collective intelligence builds when one person shows enthusiasm, recruits others, and the group begins to work together. “Just hearing something said rarely results in change in behavior. They’re just words. When we see people in our peer group play with an idea, our behavior changes.” (The Culture Code, by Daniel Coyle Pg __  ).

Here are some suggestions for how to use MyAnalytics to change habits as a team:

 * Select a few habit-change playbooks and do them together. Turn it into a competition to make it even more fun. For example, people who show zero hours of multitasking in meetings for a month win a prize.
 * Share the learning modules with the full team and carve out time during team meetings to discuss them. These discussions can help you identify habits to experiment with and select new team collaboration norms.
 * Try the “MyAnalytics Team Habit Change Program” (see the Teams section in MyAnalytics Customer Success  ). 

## Remove barriers

When we attempt to change our habits, we often focus exclusively on ways to motivate ourselves. An even better way is to also identify the barriers that stand in our way of change. To do so, think not only about what you intend to change but also how and when you plan to do it. Once you identify these barriers, then come up with a plan to remove them and change your environment. 

For example, if you want to add more focus time every week but there are no places in your office to work without distraction, then ask your manager to help you designate a few “no-interruption zones” in your workspace dedicated to focus time.
