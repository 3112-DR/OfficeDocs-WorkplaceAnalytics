## Kickoff meeting

The Kickoff meeting is the first event in your program. This meeting follows the program launch email. We recommend that this meeting be at least an hour long. Here is the suggested agenda for the kickoff meeting:

 * MyAnalytics product overview
 * MyAnalytics Habit Change Program overview
 * MyAnalytics demo
 * Survey results
 * Goal-setting discussion
 * Schedule and next steps
 * Additional resources

### Resources for product overview and demo

 * Here are slides to use for the MyAnalytics product overview: [Kickoff Meeting Deck Template](https://microsoft-my.sharepoint-df.com/:p:/p/kanowak/EeYDR2xeN55DueGxT80SwaQBMt3sP_VK4tLc4hvTIGIFUw?e=PV6PKz). We recommend that you post this deck on your collaboration channel to allow program participants to easily access it.
 * Here is a video of a MyAnalytics demo to help you and any change agents on your team learn how to use the product: [MyAnalytics Product Demo Video](https://microsoft-my.sharepoint-df.com/:v:/p/kanowak/EYFZLC62BJ1EvTwS8jzCIfYBNEebAlLC5PErmUitaxl0yw?e=DRAw5g). We recommend that you post the video on your collaboration channel, too. 

## Goal setting

When a group of individuals attempt to change habits together, a team goal increases the likelihood of success. When a team goal does not exist, individual efforts to change can be blocked by coworkers who either lack understanding or behave in a counterproductive manner. A focused team goal also makes it easier to measure the results of a change program.

We use three methods to set a team program goal:
 
 * The pre-program survey
 * Team discussion
 * The goal-setting survey

The pre-program survey highlights collaboration pain points and improved productivity outcomes. The survey might clearly point to a goal, such as focus hours, but if the survey results are inconclusive, a team discussion to gain more context and reactions from program participants might help define the team goal.

To gain more clarity on the appropriate goal for a team, have the team review and discuss the pre-program survey results – perhaps in the program kickoff meeting. Highlight any inconsistencies or points of confusion in the survey results and solicit feedback from the group about them. Focus on improved productivity outcomes from the survey to help you articulate team goals. Even when the pre-program survey results clearly point to a program goal, a team discussion has value because the discussion can bolster support for the goal. 

To develop a measurable goal with a specific example, use the following “productivity outcomes” from the pre-program surveysee Create surveys section) and a corresponding MyAnalytics metric. Goals phrased in percentage terms are helpful when a group is comprised of individuals with different work behaviors and it is difficult to agree on absolute metrics.

| Productivity Outcome | MyAnalytics Metric | Goal Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Reduce the number of hours I spend in ineffective meetings | <li>Meeting hours<li>Number of hours in conflicting meetings<li>Number of hours in multitasking meetings<li>Number of hours in longer meetings<li>Number of hours in recurring meetings<li>Number of hours in after-hours meetings | Reduce hours in multitasking meetings by 50% |
| Schedule more focus hours to boost my productivity, creativity, and decision-making | <li>Focus hours<li>Focus hours to meeting hours ratio (use the focus habits chart in your dashboard) | Spend an equal amount of time in meetings and focus sessions |
| Manage my inbox more effectively | <li>Email hours<li>Number of emails sent and/or received during and outside of business hours<li>Hours writing emails<li>Hours sending emails | Send zero emails outside of business hours | 
| Improve the effectiveness of the emails I send | <li>Email hours<li>Number of emails sent and/or received during and outside of business hours<li>Hours writing emails<li>Hours sending emails | Reduce the number of emails sent by 25% |
| Reduce my after-hours collaboration to achieve a better work-life balance | <li>After hours<li>Emails sent/received outside business hours<li>Hours in after-hours meetings	| Spend less than 1 hour per week collaborating outside of business hours |
|Spend more time with the people in my network who are aligned with my top priorities |“Your Time Investments” metrics:<li>Meeting time <li>Response rate<li>Read rate<li>1:1 meetings | Spend 2 more hours per week with select important contacts (that is, move a person from “right to left” in your “Your Time Investments” map in your dashboard) |

The outcome of the team goal discussion is to articulate an appropriate goal for the team. If only the goal focus area and not the specifics of the goal are defined by the end of the meeting, you could send a brief goal-setting survey after the meeting. In this survey, ask questions to confirm the goal area and a measurable target, and to solicit feedback from anyone in the group who is resisting the goal.  
Here is an example of a goal-setting survey:
 * Do you agree with the team goal to add more focus hours every week? Yes/No
   * If no, then please explain why
 * Please select how many hours the team should aim to add: 2, 3, 4, 5, other

## Data sharing

After a team goal is defined, you must collect baseline data from everyone in the group. Because MyAnalytics is designed for individuals, it cannot generate team-level data reports. However, the Microsoft Workplace Analytics product can generate team-level reports. In the absence of Workplace Analytics, an efficient way to collect this data is to add a request as a question in your surveys.

**To collect baseline data**
1.	Ask everyone to look at their dashboard and write down the data shown for the particular metric – for example, for focus hours. 
2.	Repeat this exercise for the two prior weeks by scrolling back in time using the date range found at the top of the dashboard, as pictured here:

<img src="../../../Images/Adopt-teams-4.png" alt="The four program phases">

3.	Ask the program participant to average the three data points and send the average to you, the program manager, to compile the results. 

During this process, emphasize to participants that their data will be aggregated and not shared at the individual level, to protect privacy. Only the program manager will view the data at the individual level.

At the end of the program, to collect the results, repeat the same process either as a part of your post-program survey or separately.

### Learning modules 

A learning module is a collection of materials focused on a collaboration topic to help the team develop new habits and to better understand how to use MyAnalytics. Learning modules include habit suggestions, habit-change playbooks, tips on how to interpret MyAnalytics data and use product features, links to articles to learn more about specific topics, productivity lessons, and fun behavioral science lessons. See the following four modules: Meetings, Email, Focus Hours, and After Hours.

[CONTENT PLACEHOLDER]

We recommend that you send a learning module to your team every other week to program in an order that best matches your team goals and program objectives. We also recommend that you bundle the learning module with a corresponding team norms survey. The survey should be completed after the program participants have had time to process the contents of the learning module and experiment with suggested habits using the habit-change method (see “Habit-Change Method”)

### Habit-change playbooks 

Habit change playbooks let program participants experiment with developing new habits by using MyAnalytics data. These challenges are examples of microlearning, a method of learning through bite-sized lessons that leverages science around behavior change and habit formation.  

Habit formation is compatible with microlearning since the key to building new habits is simplicity and starting small. BJ Fogg, PhD, a behavioral scientist at Stanford University who has studied behavior change for over two decades, said that “baby steps” are one of the only things what will change behavior in the long term.

Each habit-change playbook provides a suggested habit, an explanation of why the habit is important, and a goal-oriented plan to experiment with the habit. We recommend that, every two weeks, you select habit-change challenges that are related to your goals for your team to try. You can make this a competition and recognize team members who achieve the challenge goal to make it even more fun. The experiences and results make for a great topic in your check-in meetings too. You can find the complete collection of challenges in the following sections and in the learning modules.

## Check-ins 

Check-ins are meetings for you and the program participants to discuss program learnings, MyAnalytics, and the program in general. You set the frequency that is best for your team. We recommend bi-weekly and/or dedicating some of the agenda of an existing team meeting for program discussions. The recommended duration time is 15-30 minutes, depending on the agenda and size of the group. Meetings can be held virtually, in-person, or a mix of both depending on where the team members are located.

The following is a suggested agenda for a check-in meeting:

 * What is going well? What would be even better if?
 * Product and program questions
 * Habit-change playbook results
 * Agree on takeaways to share on the collaboration channel*

We recommend that you contact program participants a day or two ahead of the scheduled meeting to ask if there are topics that they want to discuss. This gives you time to prepare to ensure that the meeting is efficient and keeps to the allocated meeting time. Also remind program participants that they can ask product and program questions at any time on the collaboration channel to prevent questions from dominating the check-in agenda.

*If you are running a large program and the program participants are divided into sub-groups that attend separate check-ins, ask each group to post key takeaways from the check-in to the collaboration channel to keep the broader team informed of progress and to support active conversations on the collaboration channel.

## Managing Resistance 

In every change program, you can expect resistance from program participants even in the rare case the whole group initially supports the change. Change is not a linear process. People who experience change but crave the status quo will face setbacks when motivation wanes and they stumble upon obstacles. This is another reason why it is important to frequently reiterate the purpose of your program to keep it top of mind for people.

Sally Blount and Shana Carroll from the Kellogg School of Management define the three primary reasons for resistance as: disagreement about the program design, the human need for respect (which heightens during change), and the feeling of being rushed during a period of change (because we all adjust to change at different rates). 

When you or a change agent have identified a program participant who is resisting change, schedule time to speak with them directly to understand why they are resisting and what you can do to gain their support. Blount and Carroll recommend the following four ground rules for these conversations:

 * **Forget efficiency:** Motivating change requires unhurried, face-to-face, one-on-one conversations.
 * **Focus on listening:** Make everyone feel understood. Listen more than you speak and try to repeat back what you have heard as much as possible to reveal the root of resistance and develop a solution.
 * **Be open to change yourself:** Have an open attitude and be ready to learn something new and, if necessary, modify the program plan.
 * **Have multiple conversations:** In the first conversation, you listen and diagnose the roots of the resistance. In the second conversation, your goal is to make clear that you have reflected on what you heard; to outline what will or will not be different in your approach to the change based on that conversation; and to explain why. Even if you do not change your overall plan, anyone who truly listens to opposition will have their thinking changed in some way. (Overcome Resistance to Change with Two Conversations)
