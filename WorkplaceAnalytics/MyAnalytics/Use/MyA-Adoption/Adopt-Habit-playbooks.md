## Habit playbooks

Habit playbooks are examples of how to use MyAnalytics to turn specific behaviors into habits using the habit-building method. The playbooks leverage [microlearning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microlearning), a method of learning through bite-sized lessons. They are compatible with microlearning, since the key to building new habits is starting small. BJ Fogg, Ph.D., a behavioral scientist at Stanford University who has studied behavior change for over two decades, has said that “baby steps” are one of the only things what will change behavior in the long term.

Each Habit playbook provides a suggested behavior to turn into a habit, an explanation of why the habit is important, and a goal-oriented plan using MyAnalytics to build the habit. It is especially effective if you ask a coworker or your team to join you as you use the playbook, even as a fun and friendly competition.
