# MyAnalytics welcome email

Three days after an administrator assign licenses to MyAnalytics users, they receive a welcome email from MyAnalytics. They do not receive this welcome email outside of their work week. If the third day after license assignment is a Saturday (which is outside of the work week of most users), the welcome email arrives on the following Monday. 

The welcome email consists of several sections, which are illustrated here:
