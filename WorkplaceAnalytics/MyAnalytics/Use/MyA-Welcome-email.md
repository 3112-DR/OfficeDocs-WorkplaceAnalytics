# MyAnalytics welcome email

<!-- Updated for Anu and Sourabh 7 Feb 2019: -->

Up to four weeks after an administrator assigns licenses to MyAnalytics users, the users receive a welcome email from MyAnalytics. They do not receive this welcome email outside of their work week. (For example, if necessary, its arrival time is delayed to a Monday to keep it from arriving on a weekend.)  

The welcome email consists of several sections, which are illustrated here:
