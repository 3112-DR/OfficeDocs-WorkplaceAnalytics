# MyAnalytics network

The Network page shows how many people you actively connect with in the last month and gives you ideas on improving your connections with your most important contacts, such as your manager or your direct reports. 

It also shows your top collaborators in either a map or list view, enables you to view details about the important people in your network, and suggests people to add to your important list of people and grow your network.

## Productivity insights

These are based on your recent activity at work. Select **View Suggestions** to get ideas on how you might change or improve your current network pattern.

## Important people

These are people you marked as important in MyAnalytics. MyAnalytics will help you track your communications with these people and help you maintain healthy work relationships with them. MyAnalytics will remind you of unread emails from these people and tasks you need to do for them.

In the **Suggested important people** section of the **Network** page, you can search for people and then select the star next to their names to add them to your important people list.

## About the network metrics

* **Top collaborators** are based on your meetings, email, calls, and chats. If you hold a meeting with or exchange emails, chats, or calls with coworkers, they are considered collaborators.
* An **active collaborator** is a coworker you collaborated with over the past four weeks, whereas **total collaborators** uses activity over the past year.
* An **important collaborator** is a coworker who you selected as important in MyAnalytics.

## Network tips

#### Spend more time with important collaborators

Spending more time with the people in your network who align with your top priority tasks at work will improve team collaboration and increase project success. To do this, schedule one more weekly, reoccurring meeting with these people. For example, move a person from "right to left" in your "My network" map.


#### Set up a weekly check-in to stay in sync

One-on-ones are a great way to keep your manager in the loop and resolve any issues quickly. Just 30 minutes of one-on-one time each week can help you stay in sync.
