# MyAnalytics network

The Network page shows how many people you actively connect with in the last month and gives you ideas on improving your connections with your most important contacts, such as your manager or your direct reports.

It also shows your top collaborators in either a map or list view, enables you to view details about the important people in your network, and suggests people to add to your important list of people and grow your network.

## Productivity insights

These are based on your recent activity at work. Select **View Suggestions** to get ideas on how you might change or improve your current network pattern.

## Important people

These are people you marked as important in MyAnalytics. MyAnalytics will help you track your communications with these people and help you maintain healthy work relationships with them. MyAnalytics will remind you of unread emails from these people and tasks you need to do for them.

**To add a person as important**

1. Open your [MyAnalytics dashboard](https://myanalytics.microsoft.com), and then select **Network**.
2. In the **Suggested people to add** section:

   * If the person is listed, select the star under the name to mark the person as important.
   * If not listed, search for the person's name, and then select the star next to the name.

**To remove a person as no longer important**

1. Open your [MyAnalytics dashboard](https://myanalytics.microsoft.com), and then select **Network**.
2. In the **Important people** section, select **Show all**.  
3. Select **View details** for the person you want to remove.
4. In the person’s card, select **Mark not important**.

## About the metrics

* **Top collaborators** are based on your meetings, email, calls, and chats. If you hold a meeting with or exchange emails, chats, or calls with coworkers, they are considered collaborators.
* An **active collaborator** is a coworker you collaborated with over the past four weeks, whereas **total collaborators** uses activity over the past year.
* An **important collaborator** is a coworker who you selected as important in MyAnalytics.

## Network tips

#### Add top collaborators to your important people list

Things change. Keep your Important people list up to date. Follow the steps in [Important people](#important-people) to add or remove them to or from your list.

#### Set up a weekly check-in with your manager

One-on-ones are a great way to keep your manager in the loop and resolve any issues quickly. Just 30 minutes of one-on-one time each week can help you stay in sync. Research shows that top-performing managers get regular one-on-one time with their team members.  One-on-ones give employees an opportunity to voice concerns, share feedback, and stay motivated.

### Make time for networking

Making time to foster relationships and grow your network has proven to contribute to professional advancement. A team partner study showed a correlation between successful sales people and large networks. The top sales people boasted internal networks that were 33% larger than those who performed below average. In this case, an investment in meaningful coworker relationships translated to higher performance.

#### Spend more time with important collaborators

Spending more time with the people in your network who align with your top priority tasks at work will improve team collaboration and increase project success. Consider scheduling just one more weekly, reoccurring meeting with these people.
