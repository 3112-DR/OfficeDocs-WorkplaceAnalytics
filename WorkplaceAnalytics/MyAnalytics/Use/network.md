# MyAnalytics network

The Network page shows the people you actively networked with and your total network size based on work activities, such as email, chats, calls, and meetings.

It also shows your top collaborators in either a map or list view, enables you to view details about the important people in your network, and suggests people to add to your important list of people.

## About the network metrics

* **Top collaborators** are based on your meetings, email, calls, and chats. If you hold a meeting with or exchange emails, chats, or calls with coworkers, they are considered collaborators. An **active collaborator** is a coworker you collaborated with over the past four weeks, whereas **total collaborators** considers the entire past year.

* **An important collaborator** is a coworker who you selected as important in MyAnalytics. You can select people as important in the **Important collaborators** section of **Explore** > **Your Network**.

## Productivity insights

These are based on your recent workplace activity. Select **View Suggestions** to get ideas on how you might change or improve your current work patterns.
