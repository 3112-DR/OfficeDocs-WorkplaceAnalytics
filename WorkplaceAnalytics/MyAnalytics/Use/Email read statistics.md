# Email read statistics 

MyAnalytics can tell you how many people have opened your emails and how long they spent reading them. It shows statistics only about email messages that you sent to five or more Office 365 cloud users who are internal to your company.  

To give you this information, MyAnalytics displays informational "cards." This is an example card:

After you send an email message, it takes between five and fifteen minutes before you can see the statistics about it. MyAnalytics groups cards of similar topics into a single summary card that you can select and expand to see a more detailed view. 

To see statistics about a specific email message 

1. In Outlook, in your Sent Items folder, click the email message.  
2. In the Home tab of the ribbon, click MyAnalytics. 

The email stats appear at the top of the MyAnalytics panel. For example, the following card describes the status of the message entitled "Document for review":
