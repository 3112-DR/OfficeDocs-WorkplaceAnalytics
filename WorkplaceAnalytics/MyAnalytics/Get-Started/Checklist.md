# What you should do after you have MyAnalytics

After you've purchased an E5 plan or a MyAnalytics add-on, you have to configure MyAnalytics for your organization. To do this, complete the following steps:

Review the [MyAnalytics privacy guide](../Overview/Privacy-Guide.md).

[Configure MyAnalytics user settings](../Setup/Configure-MyA-User-Settings.md)

[Check that access to Office Graph is enabled](../Setup/Check-Office-Graph.md).

[Assign MyAnalytics licenses to users](../Setup/Assign-Licenses.md).

[Verify that the MyAnalytics Outlook add-in is installed](../Setup/Verify-Add-in.md).
