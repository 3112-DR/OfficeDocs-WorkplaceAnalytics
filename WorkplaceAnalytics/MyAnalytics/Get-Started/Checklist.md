# What you should do after you have MyAnalytics

After you've purchased an E5 plan or another plan and a MyAnalytics add-on (for more information, see  [MyAnalytics licensing requirements](../Overview/Environment-Requirements.md#myanalytics-licensing-requirement)), you have to configure MyAnalytics for your organization. To do this, complete the following steps:

Review the [MyAnalytics privacy guide](../Overview/Privacy-Guide.md).

[Configure MyAnalytics user settings](../Setup/Configure-MyA-User-Settings.md).

[Assign MyAnalytics licenses to users](../Setup/Assign-Licenses.md).

[Verify that the MyAnalytics Outlook add-in is installed](../Setup/Verify-Add-in.md).
