# Disable Insights by Outlook

You can disable the Insights by Outlook add-in for your entire organization by using the Exchange admin center.

## Remove Insights by Outlook

2. In the left navigation pane, select **Exchange**.

4. In the list of add-ins, select **MyAnalytics** (or **Insights by MyAnalytics**) and then select **Edit** (the pencil icon):

<!--

   This opens the **Edit add-in settings** dialog box.

5. In the dialog box, clear the **Make this add-in available to users in your organization** checkbox to disable the add-in, and then select **Save**.

This disables the selected add-in for all users in your organization.
