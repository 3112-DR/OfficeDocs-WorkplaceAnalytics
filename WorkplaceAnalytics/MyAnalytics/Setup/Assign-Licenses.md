# Assign MyAnalytics licenses to users

You have to assign a MyAnalytics license to each user who should see statistics from MyAnalytics. For information on how to do this, see [Assign licenses to users in Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/assign-licenses-to-users-in-office-365-for-business-997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc). If you donâ€™t want a user to see any statistics from MyAnalytics, just remove the MyAnalytics license from the user. 

After you assign a user license, the new MyAnalytics participant will gain access to the elements of MyAnalytics over the days that follow, as described here:  

1. **Welcome email is sent.** Three days after you assign licenses, your users will receive a welcome email from MyAnalytics. They do not receive this welcome email outside of their work week. If the third day after license assignment is a Saturday (which for most users is outside the work week), the welcome email arrives on the following Monday. For more information, see [Welcome email](../Use/MyA-Welcome-email.md).
2. **MyAnalytics elements become available.** After users receive the welcome email, they have access to the elements of MyAnalytics:
   * **MyAnalytics personal dashboard.** Users can visit the Myanalytics personal [dashboard](../Use/Dashboard.md).
   * **Outlook add-in.** Users can see the MyAnalytics [add-in](../Use/add-in.md) in Microsoft Outlook. 
   * **Weekly email digest.** Every Monday, users will receive the MyAnalytics [email digest](../Use/email-digests.md).
