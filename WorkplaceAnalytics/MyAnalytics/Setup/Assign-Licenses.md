# Assign MyAnalytics licenses to users

You have to assign a MyAnalytics license to each user who should see statistics from MyAnalytics. For information on how to do this, see [Assign licenses to users in Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/assign-licenses-to-users-in-office-365-for-business-997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc). If you donâ€™t want a user to see any statistics from MyAnalytics, just remove the MyAnalytics license from the user. 

After you assign a user licence, the new MyAnalytics participant will gain access to the elements of MyAnalytics over the days that follow, as described here:  

1. **Welcome email:** Three days after you assign licenses, your users will receive a welcome email from MyAnalytics. They will not receive this welcome email outside of their work week. If the third day after license assignment is a Saturday (which is outside of the work week of most users), the welcome email arrives on the following Monday. 
2. **MyAnalytics personal dashboard** and **Outlook add-in:** We do not recommend that users visit the [dashboard](../Use/Dashboard.md) until after they have received the welcome email. This is because their information is still being processed and some experiences will be missing from the dashboard. At about this same time, the MyAnalytics [add-in](../Use/add-in.md) to Microsoft Outlook also becomes available.
3. **Weekly email digest:** After the user receives the welcome email, they will begin to receive an [email digest](../Use/email-digests.md) every Monday.
