You have to assign a MyAnalytics license to each user who should see statistics from MyAnalytics. For information on how to do this, see [Assign licenses to users in Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/assign-licenses-to-users-in-office-365-for-business-997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc). If you don’t want a user to see any statistics from MyAnalytics, just remove the MyAnalytics license from the user. 

> [!Note] 
> Assigning MyAnalytics licenses turns MyAnalytics on for participants. Before you do this, you might want to notify them in email that MyAnalytics will soon become available. To help you with this notification, consider using [this email template](MyAnalytics-announcement-template.docx). You can download it, customize it with your company’s information, and then email it to the new MyAnalytics participants. For more information about MyAnalytics onboarding and adoption, see [Adopt MyAnalytics](../Use/MyA-Adoption/adopt-myanalytics.md).  

### MyAnalytics elements become available

<!-- Updated for Anu and Sourabh Feb 2019: -->

After you assign a user license, the new MyAnalytics participant will gain access to the elements of MyAnalytics as described here:  

<!--  
> [!Note]
> The following timeframes pertain to the March 2019 distribution of MyAnalytics features. 
-->

 * **MyAnalytics personal dashboard:** Users can visit the MyAnalytics personal [dashboard](../Use/dashboard-2.md) as soon as the license has been granted.

 * **Outlook add-in:** Users can see the MyAnalytics [add-in](../Use/add-in.md) in Outlook about 24 hours after their license was granted.

 * **MyAnalytics welcome email:** 
      * Existing users of Office 365 will receive the welcome email one to two days after their MyAnalytics license is granted. 
      * New users will receive the welcome email approximately four weeks after their MyAnalytics license is granted. 
     
    > [!Note]
    > Users will not receive the welcome email outside of their work week. (For example, if necessary, its arrival time is delayed to the following Monday to keep it from arriving on a weekend.) For more information, see [Welcome email](../Setup/MyA-Welcome-email.md).

 * **Weekly email digest:** Users will begin to receive the MyAnalytics [email digest](../Use/email-digest.md) on Monday of the first week after they receive the welcome email.
