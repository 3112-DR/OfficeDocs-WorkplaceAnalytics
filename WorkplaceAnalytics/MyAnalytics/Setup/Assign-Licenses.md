You must assign a license with the MyAnalytics service to each participant that wants to get statistics from MyAnalytics. For information on how to do this, see [Assign licenses to users in Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/assign-licenses-to-users-in-office-365-for-business-997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc). If you don’t want a user to see any statistics from MyAnalytics, just remove the MyAnalytics service for that user.

> [!Note]
> Assigning licenses with the MyAnalytics service turns it on for those participants. Before you do this, you might notify them in email that MyAnalytics will be available soon. To help you with this notification, use [this email template](MyAnalytics-announcement-template.docx). You can download it, customize it with your company’s information, and then email it to the new MyAnalytics participants. To learn more about adopting MyAnalytics, see [Adopt MyAnalytics](../Use/MyA-Adoption/adopt-myanalytics.md).  

### MyAnalytics elements become available

<!-- Updated for Anu and Sourabh Feb 2019: -->

After you assign a user license with the MyAnalytics service, the new participant will gain access to the following MyAnalytics elements.  

<!--  
> [!Note]
> The following timeframes pertain to the March 2019 distribution of MyAnalytics features. 
-->

 * **Insights Outlook add-in:** Users can see the [Insights Outlook add-in](../Use/add-in.md) in a day or so after their license with the MyAnalytics service is granted.

 * **MyAnalytics personal dashboard:** Users can visit their [personal dashboard](../Use/dashboard-2.md) a few days after their license with the service is granted.

 * **MyAnalytics Welcome email:**
  
      * Existing users of Office 365 will receive the Welcome email a few days (up to four weeks) after their license is granted.
      * New users will receive the Welcome email approximately four weeks after their license is granted.

    > [!Note]
    > Users will not receive the Welcome email outside of their work week. If a user's set work week is Monday to Friday, and the person's Welcome email would otherwise arrive on a weekend, its arrival time is delayed to the following Monday. For more details, see [MyAnalytics Welcome email](../Use/MyA-Welcome-email.md).

 * **Weekly email digest:** Users will begin to receive the MyAnalytics [email digest](../Use/email-digest-2.md) on the Monday of the first week after they receive the welcome email.
