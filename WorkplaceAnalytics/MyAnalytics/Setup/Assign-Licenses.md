You must assign a MyAnalytics license to each participant that wants to get statistics from MyAnalytics. For information on how to do this, see [Assign licenses to users in Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/assign-licenses-to-users-in-office-365-for-business-997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc). If you don’t want a user to see any statistics from MyAnalytics, just remove the MyAnalytics license from the user.

> [!Note]
> Assigning MyAnalytics licenses turns MyAnalytics on for participants. Before you do this, you might notify them in email that MyAnalytics will be available soon. To help you with this notification, use [this email template](MyAnalytics-announcement-template.docx). You can download it, customize it with your company’s information, and then email it to the new MyAnalytics participants. To learn more about adopting MyAnalytics, see [Adopt MyAnalytics](../Use/MyA-Adoption/adopt-myanalytics.md).  

After you assign one or more licenses, the new MyAnalytics participants gain access to MyAnalytics elements over the next few days, including the following.  

1. **MyAnalytics welcome email is sent.** Three days after you assign licenses, your users will receive a welcome email from MyAnalytics. They do not receive this welcome email outside of their work week. If the third day after license assignment is a Saturday (which for most users is outside the work week), the welcome email arrives on the following Monday. For more information, see [Welcome email](../Setup/MyA-Welcome-email.md).
&nbsp;

2. **MyAnalytics elements become available.** After users receive the welcome email, they have access to the following elements of MyAnalytics.

   * **MyAnalytics personal dashboard.** Users can visit the MyAnalytics personal [dashboard](../Use/dashboard-2.md).
   * **Outlook add-in.** Users can see the MyAnalytics [add-in](../Use/add-in.md) in Microsoft Outlook.
   * **Weekly email digest.** Users will begin to receive the MyAnalytics [email digest](../Use/email-digest.md). It arrives weekly, on Mondays, starting the first week after they receive the welcome email.
