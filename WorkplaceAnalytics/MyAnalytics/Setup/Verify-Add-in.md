## Step four: Verify that the Outlook add-in is installed

The MyAnalytics Outlook add-in is automatically installed for your organization when you purchase one of the E5 plans or add-ons that are listed at the beginning of this article. Users will start to see the MyAnalytics Outlook add-in in their Outlook mail applications automatically after a license is assigned to them.

You can validate that the add-in is installed by looking in the Add-Ins list for your organization in the Office 365 admin center.

1. [Sign in to Office 365](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/where-to-sign-in-to-office-365-for-business-e9eb7d51-5430-4929-91ab-6157c5a050b4?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) with your work or school account.

2. Select the app launcher icon (<img src="../../Images/app-launcher-icon.png" alt="Office 365 app launcher icon">) in the upper left and choose **Admin**.

    > [!Note] 
    > The Admin tile appears only to Office 365 administrators. 

3. Click the link to the new admin center that is shown in a banner on the top of the page.

    > [!Note] 
    > You can see the old admin center by clicking the “Go to old admin center” button on the top right corner of the new admin center. 

4. In the admin center preview, click **Menu**, click **Settings**, and then click **Services & add-ins**.

5. Verify that the MyAnalytics add-in is in the list of the installed add-ins that are displayed on the page.

If the MyAnalytics Outlook add-in is not installed, you can install it manually following these instructions. You can also view the [MyAnalytics manifest](https://agave.o365weve.com/manifest/Delve%20Analytics%20Official%20.xml).
