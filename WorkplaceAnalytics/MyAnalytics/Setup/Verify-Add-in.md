The MyAnalytics Outlook add-in is automatically installed for your organization when you purchase one of the Microsoft Office 365 E5 plans or add-ons that are listed at the beginning of this article. Users will start to see the MyAnalytics Outlook add-in in their Outlook mail applications automatically after a license is assigned to them.

You can confirm that the MyAnalytics Outlook add-in is installed by looking in the Add-Ins list for your organization in the Office 365 Admin center.

1. [Sign in to Office 365](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/where-to-sign-in-to-office-365-for-business-e9eb7d51-5430-4929-91ab-6157c5a050b4?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) with your work or school account.

2. Select the app launcher icon (<img src="../../Images/app-launcher-icon.png" alt="Office 365 app launcher icon">) in the upper left, and then select **Admin**.

    > [!Note] 
    > The Admin tile appears only to Office 365 administrators. 

3. Select the link to the new Admin center, which is shown in a banner at the top of the page.

    > [!Note] 
    > You can see the old Admin center by selecting **Go to old admin center** at the top right corner of the new Admin center.

4. In the Admin center preview, select **Menu** > **Settings**, and then select **Services & add-ins**.

5. Confirm that the MyAnalytics add-in is in the list of installed add-ins that are displayed on the page.

If the MyAnalytics Outlook add-in is not installed, you can install it manually with these instructions. You can also view the [MyAnalytics manifest](https://agave.o365weve.com/manifest/Delve%20Analytics%20Official%20.xml).
