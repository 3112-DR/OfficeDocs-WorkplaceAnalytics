# MyAnalytics welcome email

A few days after an administrator assigns licenses to MyAnalytics users, they'll receive a welcome email from MyAnalytics. They do not receive this welcome email outside of their work week. If the due date for the welcome email occurs on a Saturday (which is outside of the work week of most users), the welcome email is sent the following Monday.

The following is an example of a MyAnalytics welcome email:
