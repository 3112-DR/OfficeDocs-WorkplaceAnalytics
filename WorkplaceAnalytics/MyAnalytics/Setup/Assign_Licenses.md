# Assign MyAnalytics licenses to users

You have to assign a MyAnalytics license to users that should see statistics from MyAnalytics. For information on how to do this, see [Assign licenses to users in Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/assign-licenses-to-users-in-office-365-for-business-997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc).

If you donâ€™t want a user to see any statistics from MyAnalytics, just remove the MyAnalytics license from the user.
