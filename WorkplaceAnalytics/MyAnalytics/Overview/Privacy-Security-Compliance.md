# MyAnalytics privacy, security, and compliance

## Summary and link to a MyAnalytics whitepaper

The Microsoft vision includes a focus on empowering employees. Microsoft MyAnalytics supports this vision by helping knowledge workers better understand how they use their most important and limited resource: time. By using data that people generate as they work in Office 365, MyAnalytics helps them understand how they spend their time, and then gives them tips on how to work smarter. 

It can be challenging to explain these benefits to employees and gain their buy-in on an application that appears to store and process personal information. The [Privacy, security, and compliance whitepaper](myanalytics-privacy-compliance-white-paper-final.pdf) explains how Microsoft built MyAnalytics with this concern in mind. This content will help business leaders and Office 365 administrators who are considering purchasing, trialing, or deploying MyAnalytics for their employees.
