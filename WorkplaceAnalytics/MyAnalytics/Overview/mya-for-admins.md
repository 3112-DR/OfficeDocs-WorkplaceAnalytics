# MyAnalytics for admins

> [!Note] 
> Productivity insights that are powered by MyAnalytics are becoming broadly available for Office 365 users. [Learn more](./plans-environments.md) about the experiences that users will get in each plan. 

As an administrator, you benefit from knowing what MyAnalytics provides to its participants and what you can do to enable and enhance their experience. 

## Benefits of use

MyAnalytics can help participants strengthen their work relationships, have more time to focus on important work, and improve their work-life balance. MyAnalytics does this by showing users insights about their work habits. It derives these insights from Office 365 data about emails, meetings, calls, and chats. For more information, see [Why use MyAnalytics?](better-work-habits.md)

## Data privacy

None of a user's personal information is shared with their co-workers or managers. MyAnalytics adheres to compliance regulations, such as the GDPR. Also see the [MyAnalytics privacy guide](privacy-guide.md).

## Granting access

Participants start obtaining access to the MyAnalytics elements &mdash; a personal dashboard, a weekly email report, and an Outlook add-in &mdash; three days after you assign their MyAnalytics license. To learn how to set up and configure MyAnalytics, see [MyAnalytics setup](../setup/mya-setup-checklist.md).
