# MyAnalytics for admins

> [!Note] 
> Productivity insights that are powered by MyAnalytics are becoming broadly available for Office 365 users. [Learn more](./plans-environments.md) about the experiences that users will get in each plan. 

As an administrator, you benefit from knowing what MyAnalytics provides to its participants and what you can do to enable and enhance their experience.

## Benefits of use

MyAnalytics can help participants strengthen their work relationships, have more time to focus on important work, and improve their work-life balance. MyAnalytics does this by showing users insights about their work habits. It derives these insights from Office 365 data about emails, meetings, calls, and chats. For more information, see [Why use MyAnalytics?](better-work-habits.md)

## You and your users are in charge

* As the admin, you control the initial configuration of how your users start using MyAnalytics. See [MyAnalytics setup](../setup/mya-setup-checklist.md).
* Users can opt-in and opt-out from the start. See [Can I opt out?](../use/dashboard-2.md#can-i-opt-out-of-myanalytics).
* Users can turn off email digests if they want. See [Opt out of email digests](../use/email-digest-2.md#opt-out-of-email-digests).
* Users can turn-off the add-in if they want. See [To disable the add-in](../setup/mya-disable-insights.md).

## Data privacy

None of a user's personal information is shared with their co-workers or managers. MyAnalytics adheres to compliance regulations, such as the GDPR. Also see the [MyAnalytics privacy guide](privacy-guide.md).

## Granting access

Soon after you assign a license with the MyAnalytics service to a participant, they'll get access to MyAnalytics elements, such as a [personal dashboard](../use/dashboard-2.md), a [weekly email digest](../use/email-digest-2.md), [Inline suggestions in Outlook](../use/mya-notifications.md), the [Insights Outlook add-in](../use/add-in.md), and the [MyAnalytics welcome email](../use/mya-welcome-email.md). To learn how to set up and configure MyAnalytics, see [MyAnalytics setup](../setup/mya-setup-checklist.md). To learn more about how soon participants can see the various elements, see the [MyAnalytics elements become available](../setup/mya-setup-checklist.md#myanalytics-elements-become-available) section.
