## Tips for meetings

Fewer meetings, shorter meetings, more focused meetings. These are options you can choose to save time spent in meetings.

### Send recaps instead of invitations

Email isn't always a time-waster. It can be a useful way to decrease attendance at meetings while still keeping people in the loop. If you have colleagues whose decision-making input isn't needed at a meeting, you can email them an update after the meeting to let them know what was decided. 

### Shorten your meetings

A recent survey of executives showed that 25 to 50 percent of time spent in meetings was wasted. Some companies have introduced standing meetings. While not appropriate for all forms of meetings, a standing meeting will by necessity be shorter and more efficient than a typical sit-down meeting. Alternatively, consider shortening or consolidating recurring meetings, especially if there are more than 10 attendees.

### Rethink recurring meetings

A common productivity tip is to “spring-clean” your calendar. Try canceling all recurring meetings for a week and then, as needed, re-adding the ones that are truly missed. This has been shown to reduce the number of team meetings by ten to thirty percent.

### Rethink the attendee list

You might notice that some participants aren’t fully engaged during big status meetings. Multitasking is a common indicator that the person isn’t fully needed in a meeting. Can you send a recap instead?

### Discourage “business tourism”

The term "business tourists" has been used for people in a corporation who “make a point of attending all the meetings they can, just so they feel they are in the loop.” Successful meetings require dynamic input and focus from all participants. Disengaged attendees can significantly detract from meeting effectiveness. When you organize a meeting, try to limit participation to a more focused group so that you can reduce distraction and ensure adequate contribution.

## Tips for email

If you see that you spend too much time in email, try these alternatives: Pick up the phone, don't "reply all", or unsubscribe from email lists that aren't useful to you.

### Remove unnecessary email recipients

Before you click send, look over your recipient list to make sure each person will add value to the conversation. Think twice before using Reply All. Your default should be to reply only to the sender. Use Reply All only when your response is truly relevant to all involved. Some recipients might need to know only the outcome of decisions, rather than being cc'd on the full conversation.

### Send fewer emails - use Skype for Business or Teams or pick up the phone

Before sending an email at all, consider these insights: An organizational simplicity task force found that reducing executive email output by 54 percent resulted in a 7 percent productivity increase throughout the company. A management-tip column supported this approach by urging executives to "pick up the phone." Often, phone calls are more efficient than back-and-forth email conversations, and they allow for questions to be answered in real time. Skype for Business and Teams are also good options.

### Unsubscribe from groups that you don’t read

Consider removing yourself from groups you don't really need to be part of. If you end up just deleting the messages or moving them to your "Read later" folder, you might never look at them again. Maybe it's better to not let those messages clutter your inbox in the first place.

### Spare others' inboxes

Consider introducing the following company discipline around Cc'd e-mails: When you respond to an email, move everyone you can to Bcc with a note that states, "moving Joe, Sally, and Eileen to Bcc to spare their inbox." This gives these colleagues a chance to object if they want to stay on the thread, but it also gives them an easy out from emails that will just clutter their inbox and waste their time. This simple recognition of the value of people’s time also helps spread good behavior every time someone sees it. Pass it on. 

## Tips for after hours

Be a thoughtful coworker! 

Be a thoughtful coworker!

* For "inform"-type emails, condense the emails and status updates into daily or weekly digests. This reduces the overall noise and randomization caused by email overload.
* Save drafts or delay delivery for email until the recipients’ normal business hours. Limit late night and early morning email to urgent email, to cut through the noise.
* Turn off notifications on your phone and desktop when you are trying to focus.

As a team, be respectful of people’s time. For example:  

* Agree on “team hours.”  
* Be intentional about who you invite to meetings.
* Try to limit meeting overruns.
* Consider starting a policy of no-meetings Wednesdays.

## Tips for focus time

We define focus time as at least two consecutive hours of time without meetings. Focus time is meant to represent enough time so that you can focus on deliverables or complete other important tasks.

#### Block focus time on your calendar

Prioritize your own time and block against double-booking over it. In the same way, be respectful of double-booking over your team’s blocked time.

### Fewer meetings

Fewer meetings can mean more time to concentrate on meaningful tasks, or to rest.

### Make time for networking

Making time for fostering relationships and growing networks has proven to contribute to professional advancement. A study carried out by a partnering team proved a correlation between successful sales people and large networks. The top sales people boasted internal networks that were 33% larger than those who performed below average. In this case, an investment in meaningful coworker relationships translated to higher performance.

#### Make time for relaxation

Allowing time for a little relaxation during work hours can not only provide mental recovery, it can promote your professional success.  

#### Make time for what's important

Before you skip lunch and have a fourth cup of coffee at your desk, go enjoy a meal with your team. You’ll give your brain a break, grow your network, and probably boost your productivity.
