# MyAnalytics features

MyAnalytics provides you with three tools to help you use your time more effectively: The Outlook add-in, the personal dashboard, and a weekly summary email report. 

## Outlook add-in

The MyAnalytics Outlook add-in is a personal notification feed to help you achieve deep-focused, productive work. MyAnalytics periodically refreshes this pane with new and relevant insights throughout your workday. The information it analyzes and reports on revolves around your inbox and calendar. This information is for you and you alone. 

As a regularly updating feed, the add-in can help you:
* Manage relationships with Important people.
* Prioritize your time to get focused work done.
* Track the reach and influence of your email communications.

## Personal dashboard

MyAnalytics helps you understand how you collaborate with colleagues and spend your time at work. The MyAnalytics dashboard gives you the tools you need to help you prioritize work and spend time more effectively. By using the dashboard, you can set weekly goals and measure your progress over time.

Only you have access to your MyAnalytics dashboard. MyAnalytics does notprovide your manager or anyone else in your organization access to your dashboard. To see your personal dashboard, in Office 365, open Delve and then click **MyAnalytics** in the left pane.

## Weekly email digest 

MyAnalytics also generates and sends you a weekly email that summarizes the information that your dashboard presents. To see more details about the summarized patterns (how you spent your time, who you communicated with), click the body of this email digest to open your dashboard.
