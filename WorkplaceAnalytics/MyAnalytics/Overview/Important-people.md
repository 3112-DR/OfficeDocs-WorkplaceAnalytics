## Important people list

Use the Important people card to manage relationships and keep in touch with priority members of your network. By using this card, you can add or remove people from your Important people list. This lets you receive notifications when you've missed an email from someone on your list or not followed up on a to-do task for that person.  

When you open the Insights Outlook add-in for the first time, Insights suggests people, based on your most frequent email interactions. Over time, as you communicate with different people, an “Add top collaborator” card shows who you might want to add to your Important people list.
