# Explore

Explore in Workplace Analytics includes the following set of analytical pages as a starting point to gain quick insights into your organization's data and to identify data you'll want to investigate further.
  
* [**Week in the life**](../use/explore-metrics-week-in-the-life.md) gives a summary of day-to-day collaboration in the organization.
* [**Meetings overview**](../use/explore-metrics-meetings-overview.md) gives a summary of meeting norms within your organization.
* [**Management and coaching**](../use/explore-metrics-management-and-coaching.md) gives a summary of collaboration between leaders, managers and employees.
* [**Internal networks**](../use/explore-metrics-internal-networks.md) shows network connections between different people within a company exclusively, for example, between the sales department and the human resources department.
* [**External collaboration**](../use/explore-metrics-external-collaboration.md) gives a summary of employees' network patterns with people outside the company.

#### Page settings

You can select **Settings and filters** to view **Page settings** to the right of the Explore pages. You can use these settings to change the date range, the way to group time investors (a grouping of employees that is used in queries), and the filter for active, inactive, or all employees.

By default, the Explore pages are filtered to show active employees only. Active employees are those who have sent at least one email during the set date range (the time period set for the query). For more details, see [Page settings and filters](../use/chart-types.md##page-settings-and-filters).
