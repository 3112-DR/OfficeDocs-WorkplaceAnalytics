# Analyze data in Workplace Analytics

[**Analyze**](../use/analyze-intro.md) provides data analysts with all the tools they need to explore collaboration trends and create custom queries for more specific data analysis.
  
**Explore** provides the following set of analytical dashboards as a starting point to gain quick insights into your organization's data and to identify data you want to investigate further.
  
* [**Week in the life**](../use/explore-metrics-week-in-the-life.md) gives a summary of day-to-day collaboration in the organization.
* [**Meetings overview**](../use/explore-metrics-meetings-overview.md) gives a summary of meeting norms within your organization.
* [**Management and coaching**](../use/explore-metrics-management-and-coaching.md) gives a summary of collaboration between leaders, managers, and employees.
* [**Internal networks**](../use/explore-metrics-internal-networks.md) shows network connections between different people within a company exclusively, for example, between the sales department and the human resources department.
* [**External collaboration**](../use/explore-metrics-external-collaboration.md) gives a summary of employees' network patterns with people outside the company. 

[**Queries**](../tutorials/create-queries.md) give you the flexibility to dive deeper into your organization’s behavioral metrics to generate insights. You can create three types of queries in Workplace Analytics: Person, Group, and Meeting. Each query type can help answer specific questions you may be investigating.
