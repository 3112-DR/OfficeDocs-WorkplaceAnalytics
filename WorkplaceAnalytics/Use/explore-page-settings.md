# Page settings

You can select **Settings and filters** to view **Page settings** on the right side of the Explore pages in Workplace Analytics. You can use these settings to change the date range, the way to group time investors (a grouping of employees that is used in queries), and the filter for active, inactive, or all employees.

By default, the Explore pages are filtered to show active employees only. Active employees are those who have sent at least one email during the set date range (the time period set for the query). For more details about page settings for chart data, see [Page settings and filters](../use/chart-types.md##page-settings-and-filters).
