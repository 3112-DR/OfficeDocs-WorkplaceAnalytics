About organizational data

Organizational data is the information about employees that your company provides to use in Workplace Analytics. Workplace Analytics combines your organizational data with Office 365 to provide rich, actionable insights into your company’s communication and collaboration trends to help you make more effective business decisions.

This topic introduces key concepts about compiling and uploading organizational data in Workplace Analytics. After reading this topic you will know what kind of organizational data you can provide, how to determine the data you want to provide, what that data can help you discover, and how to upload the data.

With organizational data you can:

Know how people communicate across job functions, management hierarchy, etc. by enabling grouping and filtering on organizational data attributes.

Enable metrics customization that allow you to quantify group relationships (like collaboration time between marketing and sales).

Enable specific metrics calculations such as insularity and redundancy.

Organizational data for employees in your organization can come from the following sources:

Human resources (HR) information systems.

Other line of business (LOB) data stores encompassing business outcome data, such as:

Performance review data from specific work groups.

Employee engagement scores captured by HR outside of HR information systems.

Sales, or other quota attainment data that provide additional views into performance.

Employee survey data.

Examples of organizational data include: job family, job role, organization, line of business, cost center, location, region, layer, level, number of direct reports and manager. This data is supplied to Workplace Analytics at the individual level, meaning these attributes are used to give context to each person that makes up the dataset.

To supply Workplace Analytics with organizational data, you will have to work with the following internal teams:

Team that manages your organization’s HR information system to provide a data export of HR attributes for individual employees.

Line of business owners who have data that is of interest to analysts for inclusion.
