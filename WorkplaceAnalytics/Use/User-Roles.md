# User roles in Workplace Analytics 

<!-- [[PLACEHOLDER CONTENT]]
TEMPORARILY REMOVING THIS NOTE. 
CHANGE THIS! -->

To allow administrators to set system defaults, privacy settings, upload and verify organizational data, and to allow data analysts to be able to use Workplace Analytics, you must assign users to the Workplace Analytics service.

These are the Workplace Analytics roles and the level of access:

**Analyst role:** Has full access to all service features, except Admin. This role is used for the analyst who requires the most complete access to the data.

**Analyst (Limited Access) role:** Has access to the Home page, to explore-metrics features, and to flexible queries. This role is used for the analyst who only needs access to insights generated from our curated set of Explore-the-metrics dashboards.

**Administrator role:** Has access to the Admin and Data-sources features. The Workplace Analytics administrator has responsibilities to configure privacy settings and system defaults and to prepare, upload, and verify organizational data into Workplace Analytics.
