# User roles in Workplace Analytics 

<!-- [[PLACEHOLDER CONTENT]]
TEMPORARILY REMOVING THIS NOTE. 
CHANGE THIS! -->

To allow administrators to set system defaults, privacy settings, upload and verify organizational data, and to allow data analysts to be able to use Workplace Analytics, you must assign users to the Workplace Analytics service.

These are the Workplace Analytics roles and the level of access:

**Analyst role:** Full access to all service features, except Admin. This role is used for the analyst who requires the most complete access to the data.

**Analyst (Limited Access) role:** Access to Home page, Explore metrics features. This role is used for the analyst who only needs access to insights generated from our curated set of Explore the metrics dashboards.

**Administrator role:** Access to Admin and Data Sources features. This role is used for the Workplace Analytics administrator to set system defaults, privacy settings, upload, and verify organizational data.

### Has access to the following pages on the tool

| Role | Page | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| ---- | **Home page** | **Settings:** <ol><li>Set system defaults</li><li>Set privacy settings</li></ol> | **Sources:** Helps to verify that the O365 data and organizational data has been loaded properly and is available for analysis | **Explore:** A series of dashboards designed to give you a quick view into the way your organization collaborates | **Queries:** Deeper exploration of the data through a custom querying tool |
