# User roles in Workplace Analytics 

Users of Workplace Analytics need the proper level of access to areas of the product to be able to perform their required tasks. This topic describes the roles and responsibilities of users and the levels of access each role needs. 

## Role descriptions and access levels

These are the Workplace Analytics roles and their level of access:

 * **Workplace Analytics Analyst:** Has full access to all service features, except Administration. This role is used for the analyst who requires the most complete access to the data.

 * **Workplace Analytics Analyst (Limited Access):** Has access to the Home page, to explore-metrics features, and to flexible queries. This role is used for the analyst who only needs access to insights generated from our curated set of Explore-the-metrics dashboards.

 * **Workplace Analytics Administrator:** Has access to the Administrator and Data-sources features. The Workplace Analytics administrator has responsibilities to configure privacy settings and system defaults and to prepare, upload, and verify organizational data into Workplace Analytics.
